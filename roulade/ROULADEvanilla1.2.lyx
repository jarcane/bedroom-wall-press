Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What is ROULADE?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ROULADE is an acronym.
 It stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ReasOnably UniversaL ADventure Engine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a phrase which should roughly describe the intent of the game.
 ROULADE is a roleplaying game designed to support a wide range of different
 settings or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavors,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to use the standard parlance of the game.
 It is especially designed for those flavors in which there are a number
 of distinct power levels, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

layers,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which are nonetheless expected to interact.
 Its priorities can also be very well described both by the word itself,
 and by the words that make up the acronym, described as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
ROULADE 
\emph default
is a French word which roughly means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to roll
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (such as one might do with dice in an RPG), and describes a dish composed
 of several layers rolled together and baked into a whole, just as each
 ROULADE 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is composed of multiple layers that describe the genre and the different
 players that interact within it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Reasonably
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Universal 
\emph default
means that while ROULADE aims to emulate most genres, it is not a one-size-fits-
all solution and in fact is likely not as good for some as it is for others.
 Nonetheless, the game still provides considerable flexibility and is thus
 hoped to be capable of emulating a wide range of different settings and
 game worlds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Adventure
\emph default
 is the chief aim of ROULADE: it aims to provide an experience suitable
 to worlds of high adventure and action, and not necessarily ones where
 a considerable deal of realism is expected or required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Engine 
\emph default
is used here in similar fashion to the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

game engine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: in other words, it does not necessarily intend to provide a complete game
 out of the box (though many genres can probably be run with just this core).
 Instead, ROULADE's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vanilla
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flavor provides the basic tools and definitions on which other flavors
 can be built.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through these goals, ROULADE provides a flexible core with which to run
 anything from TV mysteries, to superhero action, to stompy mecha fighting
 giant monsters, and even to galaxy-spanning wars between gods and men alike.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Flavors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ROULADE handles the difference between different possible worlds and settings
 for the game with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavors.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Flavors define the standard names for the different layers within a setting,
 what specific character talents, powers, and training are available, how
 many points the players start with when making new characters, and may
 also define additional optional rules that further aim to emulate the genre
 and setting at hand.
 This book defines the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vanilla
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flavor of ROULADE: essentially a standard ruleset on which to build other
 flavors.
 Future books will describe other flavors in a wide variety of genres and
 settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Layers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the key features of ROULADE is the layer system.
 ROULADE flavors are often oriented towards settings with a number of distinct
 tiers or scales of power, which the game refers to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

layers.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Most games have three layers, but some that focus primarily on a specific
 power level might only use one, while others might add a fourth.
 The default rules of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vanilla
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 use three, defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Vanilla
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(Va): This is the level of normal mortal human beings like you and I, all
 the way up to the pinnacle of natural human capability.
 Pulp detectives, masked vigilantes, and adventuring archaeologists are
 all examples of vanilla characters.
 Weaponry of this layer means basic guns, swords, and knives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Chocolate
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(Ch): This level is for those who are truly superhuman, whose abilities
 exceed what even the fastest or best human could on their own.
 Most superheroes fall into this category, as do many supernatural monsters,
 and this layer is also for things like tanks, planes, or mecha and their
 weaponry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Strawberry
\emph default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(St): This layer describes those who defy not just human limits, but whose
 power is among the best in the universe, beings who can threaten entire
 galaxies or lay waste to cities.
 Strawberry characters are seemingly invincible heroes and gods, galaxy-threaten
ing alien beings, and great titanic machines that stand as tall as skyscrapers
 and can level planets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within each layer, characters and objects have a variety of ratings that
 are rated from 1 to 8 and compared on the Universal Action Table to determine
 the difficulty of actions taken between characters on that layer.
 When dealing with relations between different layers, however, those numbers
 become irrelevant, and only serious training can overcome the difference
 in weight class.
 For the sake of ease of notation, ratings can be appended with the two
 letter abbreviation for their layer, such that a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vanilla 5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Strength can simple be denoted with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Va5.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These layer names are used as a matter of convenience and neutrality, as
 befits the relatively generic nature of this core set of reference rules.
 Individual flavors of ROULADE may of course choose to describe them in
 more genre-specific terms.
 A superhero game might use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Vigilante, Superhero, Demigod
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while a game of titanic monsters and robots might use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Human, Mecha, Kaiju.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Universal Action Table
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When taking an action, characters compare the relevant rating to that of
 the opposing character or a standard difficulty using the Universal Action
 Table.
 By cross-referencing the relevant ratings on the UAT, the character then
 finds their chance of success on a d100.
 If dealing with an opponent who is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out of layer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the other hand, the character instead uses the column or row that indicates
 how far below or above the acting character's layer they are (indicated
 on the table as L +/- a number).
 If the character has any training relative to the action being taken, that
 will provide a bonus to the die roll, increasing their chance of success.

\begin_layout Standard
To use the UAT, look up the acting character's ability value on the left
 column of the table (or if the target is of a higher layer than them, the
 appropriate L+X value).
 From there, follow that row of table until the point where it meets the
 column for the opposing character's ability value (or difficulty level).
 If the target is of a lower layer than the acting character, instead use
 the relevant L-X column.
 The resulting number is the chance of success on a d100 roll.
 Roll d100, and if the result is lower than or equal to the target number,
 the character has succeeded.

The Strain Table

\begin_layout Standard
Some hostile actions taken against a character cause physical, spiritual,
 or psychological injury or stress, called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Strain.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 When resolving such actions, an additional step is taken to determine how
 much Strain the target recieves.
 The value of the attacking ability is compared to the value of the resisting
 ability on the Strain Table, with the result determining how much Strain
 the defender suffers from the blow.
 As always, layer factors into the proceedings: note the N and KO results
 in particular.
 N means the attack simply has no effect at all.
 A KO result means the target is knocked out automatically.

Standard Difficulty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters may not always be taking action that necessarily involves an
 intelligent opponent.
 In such cases, they instead oppose a standard difficulty, which provides
 the score to be used when referencing the UAT.
 The Standard Difficulty table provides some general terms which should
 help get a grip on what each number indicates in terms of difficulty.
 Note that difficulties can be out of layer too, especially those tasks
 that involve physical feats, but also tasks that might simply be either
 beyond or well below what a character's layer is otherwise capable of.
 As such, a general term for such tasks is included in the table as well.

Using the d100
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ROULADE makes use of the d100, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

percentile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 die.
 While dice of 100 sides do technically exist (the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Zocchihedron
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), they are of limited practicality, and as such it is far easier to use
 a pair of ten-sided dice (d10s) to generate a range of 100 values.
 One dice is designated as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tens
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 digit, and the other die the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ones
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 digit.
 You may wish to use different colored dice for each, and some ten-sided
 dice are available pre-printed with a range of 00-90 to serve as the 10s
 value.
 For the purposes of ROULADE, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

00
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 result is equal to 100, thus giving a range of 1-100 as possible results
 on the die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

roll low
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 technique be unsatisfactory or deemed insufficiently intuitive for your
 group, an alternate method is possible.
 Rather than attempting to roll less than or equal to your chance of success,
 you may instead roll the d100 plus your chance of success, aiming to exceed
 a target number of 100.
 Note that when using this method, an equal-to result is no longer considered
 a success: this is necessary to ensure an equivalent mathematical result.

Character Creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters in ROULADE are created with points.
 These points are then spent to buy ranks in their basic ratings, buy extra
 training, acquire special talents, and choose paranormal powers.
 By customizing the number of points characters start with and setting a
 default layer for PCs, GMs can also thus control how powerful characters
 are when they start the game, from simple mortals to galactic demigods.
 Some suggested starting points values relative to the default layers and
 different levels of expected character competence are described in the
 Character Points table.
 Each points value is derived from the cost of purchasing a character's
 SPECS at an average level (from 3 for Average to 6 for Heroic), plus ~20%
 with which to purchase training, talents, and powers.

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the following sections will further detail the costs involved in
 purchasing individual character statistics.
 Only a character's SPECS are absolutely mandatory to create a playable
 character (and sticking to just these can be a very quick way to generate
 NPCs), but it is recommended that player characters be further developed
 by at least spending some points on training and a talent or two.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Concept
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every character should have some kind of basic concept.
 This is a simple descriptive statement or phrase that ideally describes
 what the character does, what their personality is like, and possibly what
 their goals might be.
 This concept can change later, but will provide a basis of inspiration
 on which to build them.
 Some examples might be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Brooding vigilante seeking vengeance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Noble paladin fighting for peace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fearless reporter looking for a big scoop
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Simple farmer forced to defend their home
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Heartless bounty hunter tracking a new target
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concept should of course suit the flavor and the campaign being played:
 you wouldn't necessarily play a star-hopping bounty hunter in a game about
 1930s street thugs unless that kind of sudden intrusion is exactly what
 your group is going for.
 Be sure to discuss your character concept with the GM and the other players
 so that you can work together to build a cohesive group from the start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SPECS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every character is defined by certain basic ratings, described by the acronym
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

SPECS,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Smarts, Psyche, Endurance, Celerity, Strength.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Each ability is rated between 1 to 8, and placed within a given layer.
 These stats are described as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Smarts
\emph default
: Measures the character's intelligence, knowledge, and perceptiveness,
 and is used for most mental actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Psyche
\emph default
: Measures the character's willpower, mental fortitude, and force of personality
, and is used for resisting mental attacks or making social actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Endurance
\emph default
: Measures a character's ability to withstand physical punishment and stress,
 and is used to resist most damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Celerity
\emph default
: Measure's a characters agility, dexterity, and reflexes, and is used for
 many physical actions as well as avoiding attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\emph on
Strength
\emph default
: Measure's a character's raw physical power and muscle tone, and is used
 for determining damage from melee attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each ability costs a certain number of points to buy at a given rating.
 These costs are summarized in the SPECS Cost table.
 Note that if the GM has a specific layer in mind for the game, you may
 not be able to buy out of layer, or may find yourself often outclassed
 (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

over
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-classed) if you do.
 Be sure to discuss your character concept with the GM and get permission
 when buying out-of-layer SPECS.

Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Training represents areas of a character's expertise, subjects they have
 studied and practiced extensively enough that they gain an additional bonus
 to actions involving that field.
 Training can be purchased for 2 points per level of training, to a maximum
 of 3 levels.
 Training essentially improves the odds of success for actions involving
 that training, even against out-of-layer difficulties.
 For example, a character with Computer training would apply their bonus
 to the roll for an action to hack into a secure server.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a wide range of possible types of training a character might possess,
 and so no list could possibly be exhaustive, but the following should provide
 some standard examples common to many different flavors.
 If a particular type of training is appended with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(specify),
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it means that it applies only to specific applications within that field.
 The character acquiring it must specify which specific expression of that
 field they are trained in, and additional subjects must be purchased separately.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Arcana The character has studied magical, supernatural, and religious lore
 extensively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Artist The character is skilled at artistic expression, whether through
 visual or textual means (specify).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Section
Talents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Talents are those natural gifts that stand a character out a bit from the
 rest of us, the ones that seem to make certain things come easy that others
 would have to struggle to learn.
 In game terms, talents make certain kinds of actions easier for the actor
 by increasing their relevant SPECS by 1 for a specific type of action,
 or a +1/-1 bonus to Strain delivered or recieved from a specific type of
 attack.
 Each talent costs 2 point if the base SPECS is Vanilla, 4 if it is Chocolate,
 and 8 if it is Strawberry.
 Note that this shift cannot transit layers: if the character's SPECS is
 already 8, they will gain no benefit from the talent, and talents thus
 provide no assistance against out-of-layer difficulties and stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The list of possible talents is quite vast, and characters are encouraged
 to invent their own.
 Each talent should reflect the character's unique gift, and explain what
 type of action it affects.
 Talents should not necessarily involve superhuman power, that's what powers
 are for, but it might reflect the natural abilities of other humanoid species.
 Each talent should reflect the kind of unique trait that an otherwise ordinary
 person of their species might possess.
 Some examples follow.

\begin_layout Section
Powers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While training and talents make characters better at things they are mostly
 already capable of, powers represent truly new, supernatural capabilities,
 even in the case of Vanilla-level powers.
 Every power has a layer and a rating, which is the number used for its
 acting or opposing value whenever the character employs it.
 Such powers can range from magical ability and flight, to energy projection
 and laser-beam eyes.
 They are all bought in a similar fashion to stats, costing a certain amount
 of points based on their layer and rating as indicated on the Power Cost
 table.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like talents, there's an almost infinite range of possible powers, but many
 such powers fall into a number of common categories, which the following
 descriptions will explain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Afflict The power afflicts the target with an ongoing painful or injurious
 effect, requiring regular Strain checks until it expires.
 The rating provides the initial opposing value to resist it, and if resistance
 fails, it can be divided up over multiple rounds to provide the effect
 value for Strain.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Venomous Bite, Pyrokinesis, Induce Madness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Alter The power alters the properties of an object or even a character into
 something else, with the rating serving to oppose the target's attempt
 to resist or used against a difficulty based on the object.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Healing, Transmutation, Flesh-to-Stone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Attack The power can attack and deal damage to a target.
 The power rating serves as the acting value when rolling to hit, and as
 the effect value for dealing Strain.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Claws, Energy Blast, Rocket Punch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Command This power gives the character command over certain natural forces,
 and the rating is used both to determine success and to determine damage
 if it is used to injure.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Weather Mastery, Mind Control, Magnetism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Conceal The character can conceal themselves from the senses of others,
 with the rating serving as the difficulty to detect them.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Invisibility, Mind Blank, Silence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Create The character can create something from nothing, summoning into being
 some object, force, or substance.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Call Storm, Create Food and Drink, Weapon Pocket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Defense The power actively defends against external attacks and thus makes
 it more difficult to attack the character, essentially acting as their
 opposing value on opponentâs attack rolls.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Energy Shield, Super-speed Dodge, Clairvoyance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Empower The character can boost the abilities of their allies, allowing
 an ally to use this power's rating instead of their own for some type of
 actions.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Bardic Song, Healing Boost, Lend Strength
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Perceive The character possesses senses beyond the usual range, able to
 perceive things others can't.
 The rating is used whenever the sense is employed or if the sense can be
 resisted (such as with telepathic ability).
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Telepathy, Infra-vision, Supersonic Hearing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Project The power can project images or effects that can deceive or dazzle,
 with the rating being used to oppose those seeking to see through it, or
 against a difficulty based on the size and complexity of it.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Conceal Object, Fireworks, Illusory Enemy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Resistance The power makes the character more difficult to kill, substituting
 for their resistance value against certain kinds of Strain.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Invulnerability, Armor Plating, Mental Ward
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Restrain The power can deliberately hamper, grapple, or ensnare an opponent,
 and the rating serves as the acting value to restrain the target and the
 opposing value if the opponent attempts to escape the snare.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Web-shooting, Tentacles, Psycho-paralysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Split The character can make multiple attacks or actions in a single round,
 splitting the power's rating across each to serve as the acting value and
 damage of each.
 
\emph on
Examples
\emph default
: Split Image, Super-speed Attack, Extra Limbs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Summon The character can summon into being another being to assist them,
 which acts using the power rating as its SPECS.
 Multiple creatures can instead be summoned by splitting the rating between
 them.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Clone Self, Summon Monster, Robot Drones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Transform The character can change themselves or others (pick one) into
 some other shape, using the power's ratings instead of their own while
 in changed form.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Lycanthropy, Ghostly Form, Mecha Mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Travel The power allows the character to travel by supernatural means, and
 the rating serves as the acting value on any relevant rolls while doing
 so.
 
\emph on
Examples: 
\emph default
Flight, Wall Climbing, Teleportation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Weaken The character can project their power to weaken others, forcing them
 to make a roll against the power's rating to use that type of action.
 
\emph on
Example: 
\emph default
Cloud Mind, Dampen Power, Drain Strength
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each power must also specify whether its action is Physical or Mental.
 Physical powers are those whose effect deals physical damage or work through
 purely material means (such as fire projection or bladed arms), while mental
 powers are those with psychic or mystical properties that afflict or act
 through the properties of the mind and thought.
 Mainly, this affects what SPECS are used to avoid or resist its effects.
 Physical powers are avoided with Celerity and their Strain resisted with
 Endurance, while mental powers are avoided with Smarts and their Strain
 resisted with Psyche.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are likely as well many other powers that do not necessarily fall
 within the categories above, and players are encouraged to invent their
 own.
 All powers still use a core rating that is bought as usual, and must be
 specified to be a Physical or Mental power as usual.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each power should also specify the element or nature which powers it, as
 this can have effects on the game world.
 For instance, a Fire-based power might set fire to things it contacts,
 while an Electrical-based power might cause damage to electronics.
 Try to consider how your power works and where it comes from, and at least
 spend a word or two explaining its nature and source of power.
 Likewise, GMs should employ their common sense in how the nature of a power
 might apply to the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of powers is also subject to limitation from the GM and the setting
 or flavor being played.
 Some games may choose simply to limit characters only to SPECS, training,
 and talents, or limit the kinds of powers available.
 A modern-day detective game is unlikely to see much use for powers, and
 a fantasy setting might only see use of limited magical powers or monster
 abilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meta-Powers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some characters possess a power that is not in itself a single effect, but
 rather provides the ability to create widely varying power effects with
 relative ease, limited largely only by the player's imagination.
 While some combination of relatively flexible powers, and judicious use
 of flexible description can cover such talents, powers such as magical
 ability, scientific or inventing acumen, or the awesome power of a magical
 ring may require a more flexible approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of buying individual powers, a character can instead buy a rating
 in a Meta-power at double the normal cost.
 This Meta-power allows the character to manifest temporary powers on the
 fly, with a maximum rating equal to the rating in Meta-power.
 The Meta-power must be taken with a limitation, as described in the following
 sub-section, but this affords no discount to the cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subject to GM permission, a character may instead take a limited form of
 Meta-power that can only manifest a specific list of effects.
 This costs only 50% extra over the cost of the rating, but the character
 may only know as many sub-powers as the rating in question, and must still
 take a limitation with no resultant discount.
 This method is common for magical ability in worlds where there are only
 specific, proscribed spells available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some character powers have certain limitations on their use or side-effects
 upon the user.
 Taking a limitation allows a power to be purchased as if it were rated
 1 point lower than it is.
 Rating 1 powers cannot purchase limitations as a result.
 Each limitation has various effects that limit when it can be used, how
 it can be used, or causes side-effects when the power is used, as detailed
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Built The power is actually in the form of a constructed gadget, device,
 or incantation, which takes time to build.
 The power takes as many hours as its rating to prepare, but once done can
 be used as many times as its rating before a new preparation must be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Channeled The power requires time to focus.
 The character must concentrate completely for a number of rounds equal
 to its rating, after which the effect will commence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Drain Each time the power is used, its rating is drained by 1.
 Downtime or a rest period is required to restore it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Fatiguing The use of the power takes its toll on the character physically.
 Each time the character uses it, they must make a test of Endurance or
 Psyche (choose one) against the rating of the power.
 On a failure, they take a level of Strain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Fuel The power requires the presence of a particular substance or element
 to fuel itself, without which the power cannot manifest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Limited The power can only be used a number of times equal to its rating
 before it must be recharged, during downtime or a rest period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Rules The power has certain rules for its use that must be obeyed absolutely,
 or the power will refuse to function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Touch The power cannot be applied except by direct physical contact to the
 target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Weakness The power is weak against a particular element, substance, or type
 of target, and will not function against it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Willful The power is difficult to wield, and requires the utmost concentration
 from the character in order to successfully manifest.
 The character must make a test of Psyche against the rating of the power,
 and on a failure the effect simply does not work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Gear and Gadgets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, characters are assumed to possess whatever basic tools
 are required for their concept, relying instead on SPECS and powers to
 provide the relevant statistics for such things as giving and receiving
 damage or the various actions they might take in pursuit of their training
 and talents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, for distinctive objects that provide unique powers or out-of-layer
 attributes, you can instead create a gadget.
 Gadgets are essentially special powers attached to an object, and cost
 fewer points than normal powers, at the expense of being physical artifacts
 that can be lost, damaged, or destroyed.
 Gadgets are purchased as powers, but cost half the normal points (to a
 minimum of 1).
 Multiple powers can be combined into a single gadget with multiple traits
 or functions, at a further discount of 25%.
 Vehicles, for example, are essentially just large gadgets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simple gadgets use their power rating to resist damage, and to determine
 how much Strain they may take before breaking.
 Multi-power gadgets use the highest rating, or a relevant Resistance power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a gadget is lost, the device must be recovered to regain access to its
 capabilities.
 If it is destroyed, then a new one can be acquired or built given enough
 time (at least 1 day per point of its highest rating).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Strain Limit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strain is the physical and mental toll a character takes from damage, fatigue,
 or stress, most often in combat.
 Each character can withstand an amount of Strain equal to the average of
 their Psyche and Endurance ratings, rounded up.
 For convenience, the Strain Limit table indicates how much the character
 receives for a given level of both Psyche and Endurance.
 Strain is received from failed Psyche or Endurance tests against attacks
 or other stresses, and should the character reach their limit they are
 considered to be down for the count, unable to act further without rest.

\begin_layout Section
Fatigue Threshold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters can only withstand the stress of action for so long before their
 will begins to give out and they risk serious fatigue.
 Fatigue Threshold essentially defines how many turns a character can keep
 going during certain kinds of action sequences before their will to continue
 depletes and they risk Strain if they press further.
 A character's Stress Threshold is equal to the total of their Endurance
 and Psyche.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Destiny
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Destiny is a special rating the simulates a character's heroic destiny,
 their fate to succeed, at least as long as their luck holds out.
 Destiny always begins with a value of 7.
 When a character fails on a roll or otherwise wishes to dispute a result
 involving one of their ratings, they can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

challenge fate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by substituting their current Destiny value for their rating and repeating
 the attempt.
 Should they still fail this challenge, however, Destiny is reduced by 1.
 Destiny is also used when a character wishes to continue acting despite
 reaching their Strain limit.
 The character makes a test of Destiny against an opposing value equal to
 the damage taken: success means they take no Strain instead, but on a failure,
 Destiny is reduced by the amount of Strain taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final piece of a character's profile is to set them a Goal.
 Goals are how characters refresh their Destiny scores: by completing a
 Goal, a character's Destiny resets to 7 once again, thus allowing them
 to face the next hurdle anew.
 At any given time, a character should have one Goal, and the party as a
 whole that character is part of should have a Goal.
 These Goals should be relatively difficult to achieve: they should not
 be something that can be achieved in a single session, but rather within
 at least an adventure arc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individual character Goals will most often represent some specific want
 or need of the character, or even some kind of character growth (in the
 narrative sense).
 Goals are the stuff of heroic destiny, missions and quests and desires
 that once achieved will open up a new chapter in the character's life.
 This could be something like avenging a parent's murder, proving one's
 bravery against a truly dangerous foe, or collecting enough treasure to
 buy a ship to sail the seas.
 Avoid Goals that don't necessarily lead to another new phase of adventure
 without contrivance, unless the campaign aims to be a short one.
 If a character's Goal is to retire, for instance, then it will require
 some new impetus to action to create a new Goal after he does so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Party Goals are likely to be the main mission which the group's characters
 are tasked with.
 Defeating Doctor Squid before his ink-bomb turns the whole city to black,
 rescuing the Prince of Althea from the clutches of the Dragon-Witch, or
 just getting together enough credits to pay off the mortgage on the SS
 Star Tradesman, could all be examples of party Goals.
 Often, these goals will be set by the adventure, essentially making the
 Goal to complete its primary task.
 Other times though, in more open-ended or sandbox-type campaigns, the players
 will need to decide as a group what their next move is, and do what they
 must to complete it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a character's Goal has been achieved, any Goal, the character's Destiny
 is restored to 7.
 If a party Goal is completed, then all the members of the party reset their
 Destiny to 7.
 The character or party must then choose a new Goal to pursue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experience (Optional)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to refreshing Destiny, Goals can also serve an additional, optional
 purpose.
 Some GMs may choose to award additional character points to the player
 characters on the completion of Goals, or allow the character an option
 to reshuffle their points.
 The former allows for mechanical character growth, meaning the character
 gains knowledge and power by completing Goals, while the latter represents
 retooling or refocusing of a character such as might occur through a change
 in priorities or training.
 The following subsections describe how these work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Awarding Character Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some genres characters improve notably over time, even rising from rank
 amateurs to heroic legends over the course of an adventure or campaign
 arc.
 In the case of such campaigns, the GM can award additional character points
 for the players to spend buying up their character's abilities.
 Each time a character completes a personal or party Goal, they gain points
 based on the default layer of the game: 2 for Vanilla, 4 for Chocolate,
 and 8 for Strawberry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Character Redesign
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other genres, characters don't necessarily get better over time, so much
 as they change.
 Some skills might improve while others might be forgotten, and sometimes
 characters might take on a whole new focus entirely, even transforming
 almost into another being entirely.
 This can be a particularly great way to represent Goals that mark a significant
 turn in the character's nature.
 Essentially, the character's points remain the same, but upon achieving
 a new Goal they may reshuffle them more or less at will within certain
 reasonable limitations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A character should not deviate their SPECS more than 2 points in either
 direction from their original values, change the layer of a SPECS or power,
 gain a new power, or change out a power for a new one, without reasonable
 in-character reason.
 Otherwise, they may move about their points as desired to reflect the character
's new nature.
 For more restrained results, the GM may limit the character to shuffling
 only one rating, training, talent, or power for each Goal achieved.

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a character must attempt an important action which has a chance
 of failure or is opposed by another character, they make a test of the
 relevant rating against that of a target difficulty or the relevant opposite
 rating of the character.
 The acting character's rating is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

acting value
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or AV, while the opposing difficulty or rating is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

opposing value
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or OV.
 Resolving a test of AV vs.
 OV follows a simple order of operations using the Universal Action Table
 (UAT), like so:

\begin_layout Section
Standard Difficulties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When characters attempt actions that are opposed not by another character,
 but by the challenge presented by the circumstances involved, a difficulty
 must be assigned to that action.
 This difficulty acts as the RV rating for the action test to perform the
 task in question, and is in theory to be selected based on a standard scale
 based on the difficulty of a task to individuals within a particular layer.
 Difficulties of an action can be written by their name, layer, and rating
 as presented on the Standard Difficulty table.
 For example, lifting a bus might be described as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Difficult (Ch5)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When assigning a difficulty, start by thinking of it in terms of layer:
 is this task within the capability of a representative being from which
 layer? To use the default layers as an example, Vanilla represents tasks
 within the limits of normal human beings, while Chocolate would represent
 a task that even the best humans would not really have much chance of accomplis
hing, such as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lifting a bus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 example mentioned in the previous paragraph.
 Lifting the entire building, meanwhile, might be reserved for those of
 the Strawberry layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have decided what general 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

league
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or layer the task falls under, the descriptions of each difficulty level
 should provide reasonably informative descriptors from which to select
 the difficulty for the task.
 In general, these adjectives have been selected as being relative to the
 skill of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 practitioner of rating 4 at the task in question.
 So when deciding the difficulty of a computer task, for instance, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Routine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 task is something that would be part of an average work day for a professional
 programmer of moderate skill.

\begin_layout Section
Action Sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the time, individual actions and their time frames might only be
 important in the broader scope of the adventure, but sometimes who is doing
 what, when, and how quickly becomes very important indeed.
 We call such moments 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

action sequences.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 During an action sequence, the game breaks down the actions of all the
 participating characters into turns, with each character taking their action
 in order so that the chaos of an action sequence can be more carefully
 tracked.
 Combat is one kind of action sequence, but an action sequence can represent
 any number of other moments of time-sensitive excitement, from bomb defusal
 to car chases, and beyond.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Turns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During an action sequence, time is broken apart into a series of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turns,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 units of time vaguely defined as the amount of time it takes for all participan
ts in the action sequence to take a single action.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 length of the turn thus depends on the nature of the action sequence.
 In combat this is usually around 5 to 15 seconds, but for an extended car
 chase it might be 1 minute at a time.
 One could even model something like a wilderness trek as an extended action
 sequence where each turn is a day of travel.
 It all depends on the nature of the action scene, and it should be explained
 by the GM at the beginning of the sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Turn Order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters within an action sequence act in order according to their layer
 and their Celerity, in descending order.
 Thus the order of action goes from St8 down through St1, Ch8 to Ch1, and
 finally Va8 to Va1.
 Each character may take one action at their point in the sequence, and
 characters with the same Celerity are considered to act simultaneously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once all characters have made their action, the turn order begins again
 from the top at St8, and this process is followed until the goal of the
 action sequence is resolved or the turn limit ends and any resulting consequenc
es are enacted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Powers and Turn Order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some characters may have movement powers that would affect their speed,
 such as a Haste spell or Super-speed, and in such cases the relevant power
 rating can be substituted for their Celerity for the purposes of turn order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Variable Initiative (Optional)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixed turn order can be somewhat predictable and even cause high Celerity
 or speed powers to provide an unfair advantage.
 For those who prefer a bit more variability from turn to turn, or at least
 from action sequence to action sequence, the GM can call for an initiative
 roll.
 Each character rolls 1d6 and adds it to their Celerity or relevant power.
 Turn order still resolves in layer order, but within each layer, characters
 act in descending order of initiative total.
 GMs can choose to require this roll per sequence, or per turn, depending
 on how much they wish to change up the turn order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Turn Limits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases, the use of an action sequence might be because an impending
 deadline or consequence looms after a specific period of time.
 In such cases, the GM can choose to set a limit on the number of turns
 in an action sequence, and keep track of the number of turns taken.
 One can even set multiple limits as thresholds for different consequences:
 in an ongoing battle, for instance, enemy or friendly reinforcements might
 arrive at given turns.
 Once the turn limit is reached, the consequence takes effect and either
 ends the action sequence, or introduces new effects to the ongoing action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fatigue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One particularly common kind of turn limit is fatigue.
 Fatigue is caused when the action runs longer than the participants can
 physically withstand, the stress or exertion of ongoing action taking its
 toll on the characters in the form of an increased risk of Strain.
 This can be an excellent means to keep an action sequence from dragging
 out longer than is believable or desired, and is such a common effect on
 combat that it has its own rule, Combat Stress, discussed later in this
 chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the fatigue rule is in effect, each character's Fatigue Threshold serves
 as a personal turn limit, after which the characters must suffer Strain
 each round unless a test of Psyche or Endurance is made against a progressive
 difficulty, starting at 1, and increasing by 1 each round until it reaches
 8, or even continuing through L+1 and L+2.
 Failure of the roll means the character suffers from the ongoing exhaustion
 of action, and takes 1 Strain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extended Actions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common reason for an action sequence is because the characters are performing
 an action that takes longer than a single turn might, but which nonetheless
 must be completed within a certain amount of time or while under threat
 of external consequences.
 For example, the characters might need to repair the hyper-drive quickly
 before the incoming Imperial destroyer catches up to them and engages a
 tractor beam.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In such cases, the GM decides how long the task needed *should* take under
 ordinary circumstances, and divides that up by the amount of time within
 each turn, to find the number of rolls that must succeed for the characters
 to reach their goal.
 Once the characters complete that many successful rolls, the action succeeds,
 hopefully before any relevant turn limit is reached!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extended actions can be a great way of handling competitive action sequences.
 In such cases, all parties involved are attempting to reach a target number
 of rolls before the other parties can.
 A race, for instance, is simply a matter of the winner reaching a target
 number of rolls before all the other racers can.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Parties and Extended Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extended actions can be a combination of action tests from multiple parties
 adding up to a single total number of successful rolls.
 This can be a case of multiple characters with shared skill contributing
 to a single project, such as multiple computer hackers taking a part of
 the code needed to write an exploit, or it could be various skill-sets
 contributing to a collective project, each applying their skills towards
 the collective success.
 In the latter case, the GM could break this down into individual targets
 for each different task, but it can be an easier and faster in play to
 simply assume everyone is doing their part and working towards a single
 total.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Give and Take Actions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other times, an ongoing action is less a question of a race to the finish,
 and more a matter of two or more parties wrestling for advantage in a situation.
 Such scenarios work essentially like a special kind of extended action.
 There is a target number of successes, as normal, but rather than each
 party maintaining a total independently, success of their rival party removes
 successes unless no side currently possesses any, in which case they begin
 accruing successes themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, rival generals giving commands to their troops in a battle
 might need 3 successes to take full control of a hill and establish a solid
 defensive position.
 General A wins some early victories, accruing 2 successes, but his rival
 General B makes a successful strategy of his own, lowering General A's
 successes first to 1, then back to 0, then finally gaining 1 success for
 General B.
 This interplay goes back and forth, each side contributing to their party's
 successes until one side reaches the target and can declare victory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Combining Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action sequence is a powerful tool for playing out a host of different
 possible game scenarios, especially by using different portions of the
 tools in concert to handle events.
 Be creative with your turn lengths, the use of limits, and extended actions.
 Describing and creating common types of action sequences can even be a
 key part of defining a new flavor of ROULADE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Try to make sure that the result is not so time-consuming as to induce Strain
 on your players instead of their characters! The use of the tools should
 try to serve the adventure and the action, not become too fiddly in and
 of itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conflict
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conflict is essentially an action sequence where the participants are deliberate
ly trying to inflict Strain upon each other.
 Each participant employs their abilities and powers against their rivals
 in order to induce enough Strain on their foe that they are forced to bow
 out of the conflict.
 Physical combat is one use of conflict, but a conflict could also be mental
 or even social in nature, from a psychic duel to a courtroom drama.
 It's all a matter of the powers being employed and the type of scene being
 played out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conflict is resolved by the usual action sequence process, with each character
 acting in turn as normal, and making attacks or other actions on their
 turn with the intent of driving their opponents out of the conflict by
 afflicting them with enough Strain that they are forced out of the confrontatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Attacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attacks are the main method of resolution in a conflict.
 On their turn, a character can target a chosen character within the fray
 and declare an attack, describing how they are doing so and with what SPECS
 or powers they will be attacking.
 The success or failure of the attack is then based on an opposed action
 test between the relevant AV and OV values between the targets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In physical conflict, this is most often going to be a test of opposing
 Celerity values unless a given participant is attacking with a power instead.
 In a war of words, however, this might be a test of Psyche instead, while
 a psionic duel might employ Smarts (if the flavor being played is one where
 all characters possess some psychic ability).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Strain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the attacker succeeds in their action test to attack the target, the
 defender now suffers Strain.
 Use the attacker's relevant SPECS or damaging power as the effect value
 (EV), and the defender's relevant SPECS or defensive power as the resist
 value (RV), and consult the table to find the amount of Strain recieved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember that layer applies as always; an N result means the attack has
 no effect regardless of any bonuses, while a KO result means that the target
 is automatically knocked out.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For most physical combat, Strength provides the EV of melee attacks, Celerity
 the EV of ranged attacks, while Endurance acts as the RV for either.
 Magical or supernatural attacks and defenses will generally be provided
 through powers, and their own ratings apply in those cases.
 Creativity is encouraged here, however! Think of the potential for other
 kinds of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attacks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: remember that Strain is an aggregation of both physical and mental resistance.
 A character might

attack
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with Psyche in an attempt to intimidate an opponent into fleeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Knock-Out
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a character takes as much Strain as their Strain Limit, they are effectivel
y knocked out of the conflict, with whatever that may entail for the conflict
 being played out and the attack that drove them to their limit.
 Characters in a physical confrontation may be knocked out, forced to retreat,
 or even killed, while in a social conflict the character may be simple
 forced to concede or exit in embarrassment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, the stakes are up to the scene and the flavor being played:
 a gritty game of violent criminals may accept only death as a knock-out
 result, but in a game of spandex-clad superheroes a knock-out may simply
 be quite literal, and in a game of military strategy a knock-out might
 mean the defeated general has simply fled.
 It can also be a factor of what character is being knocked out: a random
 street thug might simply be killed, but player characters are not necessarily
 slain unless their Destiny has run its course.
 Individual flavors and their GMs will need to define the stakes of a given
 type of conflict clearly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Destiny
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above and in the previous chapter, player characters have an
 exception to the usual knock-out rules: Destiny.
 When a player character reaches their Strain Limit, they can instead choose
 to continue by relying instead on their Destiny to avoid further blows.
 The player may declare they are continuing to fight, and in so doing, now
 risk their Destiny to continue.
 Whenever Strain would be taken, make a test with Destiny as the AV, and
 the amount of Strain as the OV.
 Should they fail one of these tests, they will lose a point of Destiny,
 and should they reach 0 Destiny, the character must be retired, their fate
 sealed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How this retirement manifests is up to the nature of the conflict and the
 flavor in play.
 In a physical conflict this is likely to be death, but in a social or mental
 conflict this may even be a literal retirement or permanent disgrace.
 A character's retirement is often best left as a matter for the player
 to decide.
 They may thus present the desired closure for their character, so long
 as it is a reasonable conclusion to the stakes of the conflict at hand.
 Some groups may even wish to give the character a denouement of sorts,
 returning in a following scene unable to act on the ongoing events but
 present long enough to tie up the consequences of their retirement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Combat Stress
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The act of prolonged violence is incredibly draining both physically and
 mentally.
 The Fatigue rule is always in effect during conflicts involving any form
 of combat.
 The maximum difficulty of combat stress induced fatigue is 8.
 If a character reaches their Strain Limit from combat stress, it means
 their will to fight has failed, and they will immediately flee the fight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Morale Boost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of any conflict where the players' party is victorious, they
 receive an immediate morale boost that can remove some Strain levels.
 Using the Strain Table, compare the character's Endurance as the EV, and
 the amount of current Strain as the RV.
 The resulting value is immediately healed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Healing Powers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some characters may have powers that can heal Strain in others.
 Such powers are resolved by way of a special 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recovery test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between an AV of the power's rating, and an OV of the target's level of
 Strain.
 On a success, these values are similarly used as the EV and RV on the Strain
 Table to determine how much Strain is healed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Downtime
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to fully recover Strain, characters need downtime to rest and recuperat
e from their physical and mental injuries.
 During a downtime period, each player should declare what their character
 is doing to recover their strength, and can then make a test of the relevant
 SPECS or power against their current amount of Strain to completely recover
 their current Strain level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How long the downtime period takes is a product of both the main cause of
 the Strain, and of the flavor being played.
 By default, however, it is assumed to take at least a full in-game day
 to fully heal Strain, and at least two days if the character was knocked-out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Downtime periods can be declared either by the players or the GM depending
 on the circumstances.
 Players declaring their intent to take a period of downtime are wise to
 consider any ongoing time constraints involved in the adventure: a day
 lost could be the difference in success or failure of their Goal.
 Other times, a GM may declare downtime during lulls in the action, or even
 allow one as a possible action during an extended action sequence with
 a very long turn length (such as a journey taken on 1-day turns).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rest Period (Optional)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optionally, the GM and the flavor may define a shorter rest period that
 allows for partial recovery of Strain.
 A good night's sleep is a good example of a shorter rest period, but in
 a game of mostly psychological stress it might be as simple as a few hours
 relaxation or even a stop for a pint.
 During a rest period, each player can describe their method of recuperation,
 and make a relevant SPECS or power test against their Strain level.
 On a successful test, they check the Strain Table for the amount healed,
 with EV of their relevant SPECS, and RV equal to their Strain level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Game-Mastering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main tool that drives all adventures is Goals.
 The GM will need to decide which approach they are going for regarding
 Party Goals: pre-defined, or player-chosen.
 Pre-defined Party Goals means that the objectives of the game's adventures
 will be up to the adventure the GM is presenting: this can be a great way
 to handle flavors and campaigns where the PCs are expected to take and
 perform orders or quests such as military or fantasy campaigns.
 Player-chosen Party Goals means the GM leans back and let the players as
 a group decide what they want, the perfect approach for running a more
 free-wheeling sandbox or even 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tinder box
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 campaign where the GM sets up the variables and the world and the players
 take charge from there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Important NPCs should also have Goals of their own.
 While few, if any, NPCs will possess Destiny, defining Goals for the NPCs
 and NPC factions within your game world is a useful way to give them character
 and drive the events of the game forward.
 It is especially useful for sandbox-type games, where you can establish
 a game world, the Goals of players and NPCs alike, and set them against
 one another.
 With NPC Goals defined, you will have a useful grounding on which to make
 decisions and decide how an NPC might act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
NPCs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ROULADE character generation for PCs is a points-based system, but while
 this process can be enjoyable and excellently flexible for player characters
 who only have to build one character at a time, it can be quickly cumbersome
 for a GM who may need dozens of NPCs in order to run his adventures.
 It is suggested that GMs reserve the full process of point-based generation
 for the most important NPCs and major villains, those who are given Goals
 of their own and even Destiny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the rest, it can simplify the process considerably to instead rely on
 an average rating as the base value for their SPECS and work from there.
 Each of the default points values are based around the cost of an average
 rating value, which means you can quickly generate serious threats to the
 PCs by working off that average to determine an NPC's stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Begin by setting their SPECS equal to the rating average for the PCs.
 Layer will be the same as the default layer of the PCs as well.
 From there you may raise a rating by lowering another rating by the same
 amount, adjusting the values to suit the nature of the NPC.
 You can also simply start with the points value in the NPC Ratings table
 and assign them 1:1 to the NPC's SPECS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strain and Fatigue Threshold can be calculated as normal using the tables
 in Chapter 2.
 Talents and Training can be added as needed, though it is advisable to
 give each NPC no more than 1 Talent, and Training is best not to exceed
 the values mentioned in the final column of the NPC Ratings table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Powers should generally as well be capped at the same value as the PCs'
 rating average, and any powers beyond the first should count against the
 average total.
 So a 20 point NPC could have one Power at 4 for free, but a further Power
 4 would leave them with 16 points remaining for SPECS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More powerful or weaker NPCs can of course be created, and additional values
 have been added to the NPC Ratings table to suit such beings.
 Some especially monstrous or other-worldly foes might even be of a higher
 layer than the PCs, providing a truly dangerous threat that will really
 require the PCs to take full advantage of their Training to have a chance
 of success.

\begin_layout Subsection
Extras
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extras are NPCs that exist to fill a scene or even just provide an easily
 produced foe for the PCs.
 They may not even have names, and will likely only be around for a single
 scene or action sequence, and as such don't really warrant too much effort
 in terms of generation.
 Extras can be assigned a standard SPECS average that serves as the default
 rating for all rolls involving them, and all Extras have a Strain Limit
 of 1, essentially meaning they are knocked-out in one failed damage save.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Vehicles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vehicles are essentially just a package of powers in ROULADE terms, with
 a base rating and layer for the vehicles Speed and Durability.
 The former replaces the Celerity of its passengers for the purposes of
 their movement, while the latter serves as both its rating when resisting
 damage to itself, and its Strain Limit.
 Knocked-out vehicles are considered to be disabled or destroyed.
 Vehicles will usually be of a higher layer than that of mere mortals, at
 least Chocolate in both Speed and Durability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, additional powers can then be added, such as armor in the form
 of Resistance powers to further protect both its own durability and its
 passengers, Attack powers to represent weapons, Perceive powers to represent
 on-board sensors, or even a Transform power to simulate transformable mecha
 (though this could also be modeled as an interchangeable power package
 instead).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vehicles however, cannot act on their own, and so rolls involving piloting
 and targeting their weapons are still a factor of the PC or NPC operating
 them.
 Training and even some Talents may apply to these rolls as usual.
 Generally most piloting and operation rolls will be based on the pilot's
 Celerity, but a neural-linked vehicle (like mecha in some genres) might
 instead use Smarts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Loot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, ROULADE abstracts out the question of character wealth
 and mundane equipment.
 From time to time and in certain genres however, the GM may wish to reward
 players with unique pieces of equipment with special properties.
 Some adventures may even focus on recovering or constructing such artifacts,
 serving as the MacGuffin in an ongoing tale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two kinds of possible 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

loot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this case.
 Gadgets are devices or objects that provide additional abilities or powers
 to the user, and are discussed in Chapter 2.
 The other, simpler option is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exceptional equipment,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is for basic items that are nonetheless of exceptional enough make
 that they improve the abilities of the user for certain tasks.
 These devices essentially work like a Talent, providing a +1 to the appropriate
 SPECS when used as intended.
 A legendary sword, for instance, might provide +1 Strength when dealing
 damage, while the Sandals of Hermes might provide a +1 to Celerity when
 avoiding attacks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Crossovers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ROULADE Vanilla provides a relatively flexible core which can be quickly
 modified or even run as-is to model a wide array of different genres and
 settings.
 However, the layer system is not intended to be universal, and in other
 flavors the layers may be defined differently than those presented in the
 Vanilla version of ROULADE.
 As such, it can be important to take that fact into consideration when
 translating material from one flavor to the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest method is to ignore the power difference and use the layers
 as is, translating directly.
 This might result in some characters and objects becoming more or less
 powerful, but may be plenty sufficient for the purpose of play and even
 simulate a natural effect of the game world (think of a certain caped hero
 and how he responded to our yellow sun).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other approach is to provide a layer shift bonus or penalty, essentially
 shifting the layer of the character or object up or down in accordance
 with the difference in layer definition as needed.
 Some published flavors may even provide a standard layer shift modifier,
 based on the categories in Vanilla, or otherwise provide notes on converting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ultimately, the layer system is meant to provide a unique tool for individual
 game worlds, not as a universal power scale.
 Take that in consideration when sharing material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Cooking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Recipes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ROULADE comes in flavors, and those flavors are defined by their recipes.
 Recipes define the mechanical details of a specific flavor, defining the
 layers involved, available character abilities, common action sequences,
 and optional rules in play.
 Much of the

cooking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 process is just a matter of deciding which of the options and tools in
 Vanilla flavor ROULADE to use, and laying them out as needed for your players
 or even a reading audience.
 The following sections will present the usual choices that need to be made
 when putting together your own flavor of ROULADE, either for the public
 or your players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Layers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For starters, one must define the layers within the flavor.
 This can be as simple as providing them with suitable names to replace
 the placeholder ice-cream flavor names used within this book.
 Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry can thus become Human, Fighter, Starship
 in a science fiction game, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some settings might not need a full three layers.
 A film noir game of PIs and criminals might only need the basic Vanilla
 layer, with perhaps the addition of a second layer for the occasional vehicle
 or weapon.
 Other settings may entail the presence of dangerous cosmic powers, in which
 case you can introduce the Neapolitan layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your layers may also not necessarily be defined in power level in the same
 fashion as the ones within the standard flavor.
 Experimenting with the gap in power can produce better simulation of certain
 genres.
 In a game where guns and knives are much more lethal than they are in Vanilla,
 you could make the damage from such instruments of a higher layer, ensuring
 a greater amount of lethality for such weapons when employed against the
 basic human layer.
 The Neapolitan layer can be an excellent way to handle a setting with mostly
 humans, but weapons capable of vaporizing even the hardiest of mortals.
 Conversely, in a world of powerful heroes and superhuman beings, even the
 basic Vanilla layer might represent creatures far more powerful than real
 world modern humans, with the other layers stronger still.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Layer Shift
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When dealing with a flavor where the power diverges this heavily from the
 core, you can define a Layer Shift value.
 By defining a Layer Shift, other players wishing to crossover your flavor
 with their own Vanilla flavors of ROULADE will have a clear modifier they
 can simply apply to the layer to fit it into their setting.
 A world where even the base layer is more powerful than normal would have
 a +1 or even +2 Layer Shift, while one in which the layers are more closely
 defined or lower in power would have a -1 or -2 Layer Shift.
 This number will thus provide a guide on how to line up the flavor's layer
 with those of ROULADE Vanilla.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Default Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to defining the layers themselves, the cook can also define
 the default layer which the PCs are expected to begin at.
 This need not necessarily be the Vanilla layer: in a game centered around
 superheroic characters, PCs may instead be built as Chocolate characters
 from the start.
 Deciding the default layer will mostly affect how many starting character
 points a character is built on in this flavor of ROULADE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Characters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any world is ultimately defined at least in part by the characters within
 it, and there are thus a number of key decisions which must be made when
 defining a new flavor, such as the number of character points the PCs are
 built with, and what tools are available to purchase with them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Character Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An expanded version of the table at the beginning of Chapter 2 is provided
 here, giving some standard points values with which to build a character
 within each layer, and these remain the same regardless of how the layers
 are defined in your flavor.
 Once you have decided on a default layer for PCs, you can also then decide
 on a level of expected competence for the characters, and this will giving
 you the standard starting points value for such characters.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Points Limits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A given flavor can define limits on how many points can be spent on the
 different character abilities.
 This can help to ensure that players cannot spend too much or too few of
 their points on certain aspects of the character, and thus create more
 consistent results.
 The default values on the table have been calculated based on the cost
 of an average SPECS rating (2 to 8), plus an added cushion with which to
 purchase additional Talents, Training, and Powers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One common limit, therefore, is to cap the amount of points to be spent
 on SPECS to the amount of the aforementioned average, limiting SPECS expenditur
e to 5 times the cost of that SPECS rating.
 This way, PC SPECS will remain at least no higher than the standard average.
 A summary of this is on the SPECS Cap table.

Other common points limits might involve setting a standard cap for the
 number of Talents that can be taken, or the amount of points spent on Training
 or Powers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SPECS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SPECS are standard across all flavors, and should remain as is, but you
 may wish to define limits for player character SPECS if you are attempting
 a lower powered setting.
 Capping player stats at 6, for instance, would leave the 7 and 8 values
 open solely to non-human creatures or at least to Talent effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Talents and Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, Talents and Training should be available in all flavors
 unless a very rules-light variant is desired.
 It will be useful, however, in defining your setting to present a basic
 list of the most Talents and Training available.
 For those interested in a less free-wheeling approach, or wanting to simplify
 player decision making, you can even restrict Talent or Training selection
 to the pre-defined list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Powers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Powers are among the most flexible and powerful of instruments in the ROULADE
 tool set, and how they can be used and what powers are available will do
 much to shape the nature of a given flavor.
 For starters, it must be decided if Powers are available at all.
 Some relatively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

realistic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 settings may simply not have them present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, you will want to decide what Powers are available.
 Are the players free to imagine powers to their hearts desire so long as
 they fit within the setting, or are they restricted to certain types or
 power, or even to a pre-defined list? Are meta-powers available, or gadgets?
 Are limitations available, or even mandatory?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spell Lists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many, many settings, especially fantasy ones, involve regular access to
 magical or supernatural powers that are commonly available.
 In such cases, rather than requiring a magic-wielding character to buy
 a meta-power or even individual lists of powers, you can instead provide
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spell list
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which contains an array of available powers of different ratings.
 A character can learn spells from this list by first purchasing a basic
 Talent like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Magery
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that grants them access to spells, and they can then learn and cast spells
 and powers from the list so long as the rating of the spell in question
 is not greater than the relevant SPECS for spell-casting in this world.
 Spells learned in this way should 
\emph on
always 
\emph default
involve a limitation still, usually Channeled, Fatiguing, or Willful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Common Gadgets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While basic gear should generally be left up to abstraction, some settings
 may contain pretty commonly available gadgets that can be purchased for
 characters.
 The most common such are uniquely powerful weapons and armor that might
 provide out-of-scale abilities, or else special devices that provide uniquely
 useful powers to the setting and nature of the adventures.
 Vehicles are also an important element of any setting, and you may define
 them with points values for player acquisition (purchasing basic Speed
 and Durability at SPECS cost for the layer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Strain Limit and Fatigue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default Strain and Fatigue Threshold calculations should be abstract
 enough to suit most games with some creative interpretation, but if you
 wish to create more or less dangerous games you can tweak the formulas
 for these values.
 For example, you could make a game less lethal by making the Strain Limit
 a total rather than an average, or shorten the length of combat by having
 Fatigue Threshold use the same average table as the Strain Limit.
 You could also provide a simple multiplier to the standard formulas, such
 as .5x or 2x.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Destiny
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Destiny is the tool that allows ROULADE characters to maintain a certain
 heroic fate, to survive where mere NPCs might simply fail, and to challenge
 the randomness of life as a character in a roleplaying game.
 Of course, for some games, this added layer of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plot immunity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may not be acceptible.
 A gritty game of front-line soldiers in WWI might require its PCs to be
 a bit more doomed, with death always looming at the end of their Strain
 Limit.
 As such, you may wish to set Destiny at a lower value, or remove it altogether
 and force PCs to let the dice fall where they may.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another option is to make Destiny purchasable, requiring levels of it to
 be bought for an amoint of points per level.
 It is recommended in such cases that this value be at 4 points per Destiny
 point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goals are how characters regain their Destiny, and if you're using that
 rule, earn experience.
 As a result, how they work has a powerful effect on the flow of the game
 and on the players' priorities.
 When laying out your recipe, you will need to decide how freeform to be
 with player Goals, as well as decide whether or not to use pre-defined
 or player-chosen Party Goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allowing the players to define their own Goals gives them an excellent space
 in which to define their characters and their own personal motivations
 for play, but setting pre-defined goals can be a great way of simulating
 the nature of fate or how characters improve themselves in the game world.
 You can even use pre-defined goals to simulate the levelling or experience
 systems of other roleplaying games: a game of plundering pirates or dungeoneeri
ng adventurers could simply set a standard Goal of acquiring X amount of
 treasure, upon which the character gains new character points and the value
 resets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in Chapter 4, whether the party or the adventure defines the
 Party Goal similarly is a function of the type of game at hand.
 In a very mission-driven game, it's likely that the PCs will mostly be
 carrying out specific quests or assignments as a group, such as the members
 of a special forces squad.
 On the other hand, a more open world sort of game such as a flavor about
 space exploration, might be entirely driven by player-determined Party
 Goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experience
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main decision to be had with the experience system is simply whether
 to use it, and if so, which one.
 This is an important decision for the long-term of the game and for the
 style and genre being emulated.
 Many characters in some fictitious genres change very little over time
 in terms of their capabilities, and are thus more suited to the default
 mode of no experience system.
 However, other adventure milieus are all about the rise from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zero to hero,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or about the possibility that characters can at least change over time
 and become something other than they once were.
 Keep in mind too that especially when rewarding character points, this
 can make for a case where long-term campaigns can see GMs facing ever more
 powerful PCs to try and challenge.

\begin_layout Subsection
Packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For certain flavors, there may be a number of common abilities which characters
 either possess or at least might have access to as a single, group of abilities
 or powers.
 For such situations, one can use packages.
 Packages are predefined lists of Training, Talents, and Powers, and come
 in two forms: default packages, and purchasable packages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Default packages are groups of abilities that all characters created for
 the flavor automatically possess for free.
 For example, in a game about fighter pilots, all PCs might automatically
 gain Training in Piloting and Navigation.
 Default packages are applied to all player characters, and thus are most
 suited to abilities that are considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the norm
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the game world, or to flavors in which all PCs are expected to play
 the same basic character type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Purchasable packages are groups of abilities with pre-figured points costs
 that a PC can choose purchase at character creation.
 This is a great way to present common character types without making them
 mandatory.
 A purchasable package might contain a group of Talents and Powers to represent
 a common non-human species in a SF game.
 Another package might contain a selection Training categories to represent
 a common occupation.
 Purchasable packages are a great tool for speeding up the process of chargen
 for players without necessarily taking the full flexibility of ROULADE
 character creation off the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Abandoning Points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the most drastic of changes one can employ is simply the abandonment
 of the point buy method altogether.
 By discarding the point-buy system you can instead provide a more proscribed
 order of character creation.
 This can be less flexible, but be advantageous for certain types of games
 where character abilities are expected to be a bit more standardized, such
 as one where players are expected to have an array of powers that is difficult
 to accomplish with even the highest standard point values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In non-point buy chargen, the process follows something like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
SPECS are assigned either by a random roll (1d8), or by starting at an average
 and moving values from there (use the NPC Ratings table in Chapter 4).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Characters have X number of points to distribute among Training.
 This X may be a flat value, or based on one of the SPECS (usually Smarts).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Characters recieve a number of Talent picks, usually from 1 to 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If allowed, Powers can be selected simply as a pool of points, with a 1:1
 ratio to those points (2:1 for meta-power, or 1:2 for gadgets).
 Limitations may provide a free point of rating.
 Point total here can be calculated from a multiplier to the average SPECS
 based on the number of powers PCs are expected to have.
 A default layer can be set seperately for Powers as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Strain Limit, Fatigue Threshold, Destiny, and Goals are all determined as
 normal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method is considerably less flexible than the default method, but can
 also be quicker and allow for a more guided approach to the process, especially
 if paired further with default packages in specific categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important factor in any flavor is creating and describing the kinds
 of actions and action sequences that are commonplace in the setting.
 Action sequences are an incredibly powerful and flexible mechanical tool,
 and can be used as everything from a tool for adjudicating key focuses
 of the game, to even defining the very flow of the game itself.
 In theory, an entire game session could consist entirely of carefully defined
 action sequences and conflicts, punctuated by downtime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the least, one should define the standard features of the most common
 kinds of action sequences and conflicts within the setting, as well as
 any of the options that are in play, such as variable initiative, fatigue,
 and rest periods.
 Chapter 3 provides much of the hows and whys of this process already, but
 the following subsections will present a brief summary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Action Sequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When defining an action sequence, you need to know what kind of action the
 sequence centers around first and foremost, and thus what SPECS or Powers
 will be involved.
 The type of action will also inform how long the turns are, as these will
 be based on the time scale such actions generally take place in.
 If the action has a certain time by which it must be completed, you will
 want to set the turn limit to the appropriate number based on the length
 of the turns.
 If the action is one that will cause the participants to endure fatigue,
 be sure to specify this, and specify any modification to the normal Fatigue
 Threshold rules.
 Finally, if it is to be an extended or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

give and take
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 action, be sure to define the target number of successful actions that
 must be made to succeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conflict
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defining the most common kinds of conflict, and what is involved, is especially
 important.
 You will need to define the turn length once again, as well as the nature
 of the conflict, and thus what SPECS apply to both 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attack
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rolls, and to tests against Strain.
 You must declare the stakes for knock-outs as well: this tells you what
 happens to characters or NPCs who hit their Strain Limit.
 Stakes can be defined separately for PCs and NPCs in a conflict, if you
 wish one or the other to be more threatened by the conflict.
 You may also wish to pre-define some probable results of a PC's retirement
 from lost Destiny, if only as a general guideline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Downtime
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not technically a kind of action sequence, but an important factor nonetheless,
 as this is how your PCs will be able to recover from Strain taken in the
 course of the previous actions.
 You will want to define the standard downtime period, and also decide whether
 rest periods are allowed, and how long they last as well.
 You may also wish to define limits or triggers on when downtime and rest
 can occur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Setting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides mechanics, the meat of any flavor of ROULADE is the remaining setting
 material.
 A lot of this will already be defined by the decisions you've made earlier
 in the cooking process, especially by what options are available to characters.
 Depending on your intent, you can thus make your setting material here
 as simple as a few paragraphs of exposition, to an entire volume.
 In general, if you're aiming for a concrete world, however, you'll want
 to see about defining important NPCs and NPC factions, species, geography,
 common technology and equipment, and so on and so forth.
 The breadth of detail possible here is limited only by the imagination,
 but should be alt least enough detail so that the PCs can develop characters
 to fit within it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Sample Flavor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is a simple example of what is possible with creative use
 of the tools outlined above, and also provides a sample outline of how
 to organize such flavors.
 Note, for instance, that it's only necessary to define where rules diverge
 from the standard Vanilla core, in order to conserve space and time for
 the reader!

 Then, from the void, came monsters.
 Horrifying bioweapons of an advanced race that had already wiped out half
 of the known galaxy, spreading its ships and biomechs across the stars
 and consuming all in their path.
 They were the Kiiraga, the Death of a Thousand Worlds, and they knew only
 hunger and conquest.

To face this tremendous evil the Void Strikers were created: advanced, transform
able mecha that could face the biomechs on their own terms.
 The Void Pilots who operate these mecha serve aboard space carriers, which
 patrol the edges of civilized space and face the threat of the Kiiraga
 wherever they rear their head and threaten humanity's borders.
 The advanced neural link within the Void Striker system allows the pilot
 to react to enemy attacks at the speed of thought, far faster than a normal
 space fighter ever could, and it has given humanity the chance to survive
 once again.
