This folder contains the source documents for Arcana Rising, our urban fantasy roleplaying game.

Due to the number of embedded images, the Arcana Rising corebook file is too large to be hosted on Github.

Instead, you may find it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3hWDeEiNI5aay1OaDE2UExHaVk/edit?usp=sharing

In the future, it is hoped that an image-free version of the document can be provided.
