\begin_layout Chapter
The Saurian War
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expansion of humankind into the galaxy was largely peaceful in the early
 years.
 With the Great Plague having wiped clear much of the sentient life in the
 galaxy prior to humanity's emergence, the biggest threats to exploration
 were only from the horrors left behind by the plague, or rogue elements
 from human civilization in the form of claim-jumpers and pirates.
 The few sapient races encountered generally proved friendly, either in
 the midst of their own exploration phase themselves or simply eager for
 new friends in a lonely and hostile universe.
 The discovery of these new species gave new hope that the galaxy might
 not be a complete void of other intelligent life despite the ravages of
 the Plague, and new effort was expended especially towards seeking out
 new civilizations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, humanity and its new allies were soon to face their first great
 challenger.
 Someone else was hunting the stars, not for friends, but for humanity itself.
 They were seeking Earth, and they meant to claim it for their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Saurians
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Millions of years ago, on the eve of the asteroid impact that would trigger
 the last great extinction event of Earth's prehistory, a desperate plan
 was hatched.
 
\emph on
Arcanoraptor, 
\emph default
a young species of sapient theropods constructs a series of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

seed pods
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which will bear forth across the galaxy in an attempt to save their species
 from extinction.
 Unable to construct a large enough vessel with enough supplies for ongoing
 life, instead the arcanoraptors store eggs from their best and brightest
 in stasis, only to be hatched once they pod itself has landed on a planet
 with suitable atmosphere.
 On each pod is a plaque, engraved with information about the destinations
 of each other pod of dozens launched, along with coordinates for Earth's
 sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the pods do not survive, and even those that do take millions of
 years to arrive at their destination.
 While the pod and the eggs themselves provide just enough nutrients for
 the hatching arcanoraptors to survive initially, only their own wits will
 allow them to survive beyond this point.
 Their civilization is lost, preserved only in the information inscribed
 within the capsules, and the cataclysm that wiped out most life on earth
 larger than small mammals and birds erased almost any trace of this lost
 space-faring society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hurtling through space at a speed barely faster than the earliest human
 deep space probes, the pods survived the ravages of the Great Plague largely
 through obscurity.
 Most missed their marks, or were destroyed by other forces.
 Some did survive, however.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One pod thrived above all, and managed to rebuild a new civilization with
 remarkable haste.
 Landing on the second planet of a small yellow sun not unlike our own,
 the newborn hatchlings found fertile soil, plentiful food, and a large
 single continent not unlike the Pangaea they had left behind on Earth.
 Eventually, one tribe would unite the scattered survivors, and thus the
 Rax Empire was born.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Hunt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its internal conflicts resolved, the Rax Empire set about looking inward
 into their own forgotten history.
 They re-discovered the lost seed pod that placed them on their world, and
 this piece of their lost heritage came to be held with religious reverence.
 Rax scholars would study the words and inscriptions of their lost ancestors
\emph on
 
\emph default
for generations.
 As their society grew and advanced to the space age they made it their
 mission to unite the other survivors of Earth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This continual mission would come to be known as The Hunt, and would remain
 the uniting drive for the species as it expanded into the rest of the galaxy
 around Rax Prime.
 The Hunt eventually re-united many of the lost surviving descendants of
 the seed pods, and through this reunification the Great Rax Empire became
 a galactic power to rival the expansion of humanity, making their eventual
 contact that much more inevitable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Contact
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a Surveyor team that first encountered the Rax.
 A first-time crew with a fresh claim, the 
\emph on
GSS Mauve-Taupe
\emph default
 exited subspace just outside the Gamma Orionis system, directly in the
 path of an oncoming Rax freight hauler.
 After considerable confusion and panic on both sides, the two sides managed
 to avoid conflict long enough for the 
\emph on
Mauve-Taupe
\emph default
's science officer to translate the incoming terrified chatter from the
 Rax ship and talk both sides down from a potentially embarrassing incident.
 The 
\emph on
Mauve-Taupe 
\emph default
was then directed to Gamma Orionis IV, a small and rocky world hosting a
 Rax mining colony, to introduce themselves to the local colonial administrator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Met with a warm welcome at first by the local authorities, the conversation
 quickly turned sour when one of the 
\emph on
Mauve-Taupe
\emph default
's crew, a human engineer, explained where he was from.
 The administrator quickly made the connection between the human homeworld
 and that spoken of in the ancient pod text, and grew more and more furious.
 Taking disgusted offense at the very idea of a bunch of egg-eating, mammal-desc
endants claiming residence of their holy ancestral grounds, he ordered the
 lot arrested.
 The crew of the 
\emph on
Mauve-Taupe
\emph default
 managed to escape capture only through use of a barely functioning teleport
 bay and a slow reaction on the part of the Rax station's port authority.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They reported only of a hostile exchange with an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unknown saurian species
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the science officer's translator failed to understand the term 'Rax' as
 a name for the species, and they continue to be largely known as 'Saurians'
 in Tradespeak).
 The report simply advised avoiding that space until more formal diplomatic
 ties could be established.
 Thanks to this understated report and the inevitable bureaucratic delays
 involved in Guild report processing, humanity was thus initially unaware
 that it had just started an interstellar war.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
War
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
News of Earth's survival and habitability was quickly sent upwards to the
 Holy Rax Emperor, who formally declared war on the human species and the
 intent of the Rax Empire to reclaim its ancestral homeland.
 Skirmishes and raids on outlying colonies began not long after, and soon
 the known galaxy was embroiled in the largest conflict in human history.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the front roared on, humanity called on its friends and allies to bolster
 their numbers against the highly organized and at times brutal Saurian
 armada, even recruiting from among newly discovered pre-starfaring peoples
 in exchange for membership in the growing Human Alliance.
 The first androids also found their way into service across the fleets
 of the Alliance, and the Surveyor's Guild became a vital part of the war
 effort as well.
 Exploration priority was placed on locating valuable raw materials and
 new technology that could supply the front and provide an edge to the Alliance
 in the ongoing conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
About This Book
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This book in the first of a planned line of companion volumes for 
\emph on
Hulks and Horrors
\emph default
, and as such will require the 
\emph on
H&H
\emph default
 core book to make the most complete use of.
 Each companion volume provides an assortment of options for players and
 GMs to bring into their games, from new classes, to alternate rules, to
 additional adversaries and more.
 This first volume focuses primarily on playing games of 
\emph on
H&H 
\emph default
centered around the job of a Surveyor during wartime, seeking to expand
 player options and especially exploration results to suit.
 The setting background of this book and those to follow exists largely
 as a framing device for the gameplay tools within, and GMs are free to
 ignore it in pursuit of their own campaign settings.
 Later volumes will tackle further subjects, but the important takeaway
 is that all of these rules are considered optional, and thus it is best
 to discuss with your group which options will be in play.
 Remember Rule Number One! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Characters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploration of a galaxy in a state of war is a different prospect than that
 of one in relative peace-time.
 While the threat of rogue elements has always been a part of a surveyor's
 job, and the ruins of the ancients remain ever filled with hazards and
 horrors galore, the realities of life during the Saurian War lead to new
 faces and new skill sets finding their way into the ranks of the Guild.
 The following chapter presents some new options for existing classes, as
 well as new classes entirely, for player characters during and after the
 Saurian War.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Improving Saves and Abilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Hulks and Horrors 
\emph default
classes are designed with the expectation that all characters are at least
 minimally trained in the full range of expected abilities for a surveyor
 or explorer.
 The classes are thus designed more as chosen careers, and like in any job,
 there can be good or bad examples of the field.
 The more important consideration in design thus was making characters vary
 widely, and allowing every character to try any action (this is also why
 there are few 'exclusive' abilities in 
\emph on
H&H 
\emph default
classes).
 Some gamers however may prefer more sharply defined classes that better
 guarantee a stronger level of competence at the classâs particular talents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optionally then, you may consider allowing class abilities and saves to
 improve with level.
 This will allow distinction between classes to improve as each class becomes
 more experienced at its own particular set of skills.
 Under this rule, class abilities that provide a +1 to specific stat checks
 (including saves), now improve by a further +1 at levels 3 and 6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Combat Pilots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the outbreak of the Saurian War, more and more pilots are cutting their
 teeth in the field of battle rather than threading through the debris fields
 of Dyson Prime.
 Pilots trained in the combat forces who find themselves no longer qualified
 for duty, unable to cope with the stress of the battlefield, or simply
 too free-spirited for military service often turn to Guild work instead
 as surveyors.
 Such combat-trained pilots are increasingly in demand as well, as skirmishes
 between Alliance and Saurian forces in unexplored sectors continue.
 Each side in the war is eager to hunt down new resources and new technologies
 to bring to the front, and this means ship-to-ship combat is an expected
 hazard in the uncharted reaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pilots wishing to take a more combat-oriented specialty can optionally exchange
 their 
\emph on
Daredevil 
\emph default
ability for a new talent, 
\emph on
Combat Pilot
\emph default
.
 This replaces the pilot classâs knack for barnstorming heroics, for skill
 at keeping their ship a difficult target to track in a fight.
 The details of this new ability are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\emph on
Combat
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Ace:
\series default
\emph default
 The combat pilot is an expert at dodging and maneuvering a ship through
 heavy enemy fire, able to thread their vessel through the fray with precision
 unrivaled.
 When called upon to make any piloting roll in combat, the combat pilot
 may choose to roll 2D20, and keep the highest result.
 If they succeed, the maneuver is successful as usual but the ship gains
 a further -1AC until the next round.
 If they fail, however, they have lost control of the ship, and no maneuvering
 rolls can be attempted until control is regained, leaving the ship at +2AC
 until a DEX check is passed (combat ace cannot be used on this check.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Soldier MOS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to the Saurian War, few soldiers saw combat with any regularity.
 Most tended to remain in the service as career soldiers in sleepy garrisons
 or administrative desks, or muster out into civilian careers.
 Those veterans who were willing to volunteer for a surveyor crew tended
 to be from special operations and quarantine units, who had seen combat
 against plague horrors and worse, and thus were relatively more willing
 to sign on for the dangerous life of an explorer and hulk hunter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the War however, a greater variety of former military personnel have
 found themselves out of military work, having been injured, declared unfit,
 or even deserted.
 There is thus a greater variety in the specialties of those soldiers finding
 work on surveyor teams.
 As well, those groups wishing to run military campaigns focused directly
 on the action of the war, may wish to be able to portray the broader range
 of talents possible within the soldier class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to better portray this diversity, soldiers may choose to exchange
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Covert Ops
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ability of the class for one of the following Military Occupational Specialties
 (or MOS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Armored This soldier was employed in the armored division, operating land
 vehicles from transports to tanks.
 the character has a +1 to stat checks involving the operation of land vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Exo-Armor The soldier was a member of an exo-armor unit, trained in the
 operation of powered armor suits.
 The character has a +1 to-hit with hardpoint mounted weapons, and may purchase
 a basic exo-armor (AC1) for half price at character creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Gunnery The soldier served as an artillery officer, tank gunner, or other
 heavy gun operator.
 They have a +1 to-hit with mounted weapons and artillery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Infantry The character was a basic ground-pounder, marching through the
 fields of some god-awful rock.
 They've developed considerable stamina for forced marches, gaining a +1
 to CON for saves against fatigue when travelling on foot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Logistics Not the most exciting career in the armed forces, but a vital
 one, the soldier served as part of the logistical or supply division.
 A life of navigating military bureacracy for supplies has made them a shrewd
 bargainer: they pay 10% less for equipment purchases at character creation,
 and they have a +1 to CHA for any negotiations involving trade transactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Marine The soldier is a true space marine, a front-line hardened invader
 and shipboard combat expert.
 Marines count zero gravity as a favored environment, and their gung-ho
 attitude gives them a +1 to DEX for the purpose of initiative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Marksman The soldier is a designated marksman or sniper, trained in expert
 accuracy at considerable distance.
 The soldier has a +1 to-hit with rifles, and may attack targets up to 300
 yards distant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Mechanic The soldier worked in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motor pool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repairing vehicles.
 They have a +1 to INT for the purposes of repairing land and air vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Recon The character served in a recon or patrol unit, requiring them to
 travel quickly through unknown or difficult terrain and provide accurate
 information about enemy positions.
 The soldier and their group suffer half the usual penalties when traversing
 difficult terrain, and the recon soldier gains a -1 to AC while in such
 terrain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Survival Further deep recon units and even individual scouts are sometimes
 deployed.
 The soldier has recieved extensive training on surviving with limited equipment
 in hostile terrain, and gain a +1 to WIS checks to locate food and water
 in the surrounding area.
 On a successful check and with 1d4 hours' time, the soldier finds sufficient
 food and water for themselves to survive another day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Engineer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part technical wizard and part handyman, engineers are masters of maintenance,
 experts at engines, and triumphant troubleshooters.
 Engineers are absolutely indispensable to keeping a good ship running,
 and just as handy planet-side when it comes time to quickly repair broken
 equipment, puzzle out some piece of alien tech, or just keep everyone's
 guns and other implements of destruction fully functioning at their peak
 efficiency.
 A good engineer should have a high INT, the better to perform their repairs,
 and usually possesses a pretty high DEX as well, and often decent STR,
 both handy attributes to have on the job, as both dexterity and even raw
 strength come in handy in the line of work for a ship's engineer.

: The engineer's role on the ship is to keep it working, and also to regulate
 the flow of power to vital systems.
 While the engines will generally give enough juice to keep things running
 unless they've been damaged, sometimes a little extra juice can charge
 a system enough to give it an edge in a fight.
 Each round of ship combat, the engineer can declare they are transferring
 power to one and only one of the ship's systems, with varying results depending
 on the system (listed below).
 They make an INT check, and on a success, the system gains the described
 bonus, but on a roll of 20, the system is overloaded, and takes the opposite
 effect until emergency repairs can be applied to the affected system.
 They may attempt to further boost a powered up system a second time and
 double the bonus, however this time the system will overload on a simple
 failure, and the penalty for failure is similarly doubled.
 Only one system can be boosted on any given round, and boosting another
 system cancels the effect of the previous boost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Power may also be transferred to overcome damage to certain systems, temporarily
, but at greater risk of overload and further damage.
 A damaged system can be restored to normal function for as long as the
 boost remains in place, but overloads on a simple failure of the INT check
 needed to transfer the power, and becomes disabled instead.

 By making a successful INT check, the engineer can make any damaged or
 even broken machine or system work for the next 1d6 rounds per level, at
 the cost of an extra 10 minutes per round rolled of repair time needed
 later.
 This jury-rigging can be continued, however there is a cumulative -1 INT

 the device is permanently broken and will not be repairable in the field

The Llorrai
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
21 Lockhart IV is a rather unassuming name for what would prove to be one
 of the bloodiest battlefields of the entire Saurian War.
 A humid quagmire of jungles and swamps punctuated by wide rivers and open
 fields of 2-meter tall grasses, the planet was also ripe with rare earth
 metals vital for construction of new fusion drives and energy weapons,
 and smack in the middle of a major space lane for both Alliance and Saurian
 forces.
 Sent into the planet's harsh jungles to attempt to oust the Saurian colony,
 Alliance ground troops dubbed the world by another name: Paradise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caught in the midst of this endless fighting were the Llorrai (singular:
 
\emph on
Llorra
\emph default
, lit.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), the indigenous capyfolk people of Paradise.
 A mix of agrarian and hunter-gatherer tribes, the Llorrai were only barely
 on the cusp of civilization when the Saurian Empire settled on the planet.
 The occupying Saurian forces quickly set the capyfolk beneath their scaly
 heel, taking over farms and enslaving laborers for mining and manufacturing
 work.
 Unrest grew, and soon many Llorrai took up arms, stealing weapons and taking
 advantage of their experience with the local terrain to stymie Saurian
 troops.
 By the time the Alliance invaded, Paradise was already on the verge of
 a full civil war, and the human forces initially found the Llorrai guerillas
 to be as much trouble as the Saurians.
 Alliance troops would seize Saurian outposts only to find themselves under
 attack from behind the lines by Llorrai jungle fighters they'd simply never
 seen.
 Soldiers on both sides of the conflict told ghost stories about the Llorrai

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually, however, the Alliance would secure an alliance with the Llorrai,
 offering safe asylum for refugees and full support for an independent Llorrai
 state in exchange for first trading rights to Paradise's rare mineral reserves.
 Through this treaty, the Llorrai became a valuable ally in the ongoing
 battle, and Llorrai hunters even found their way into service elsewhere
 in the Alliance military and even the Surveyor's Guild.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In appearance, the Llorrai resemble many other capyfolk species found across
 the galaxy.
 Bearing a squarish head with long muzzle, prominent incisors, thick fur,
 and slightly-webbed hands and feet, the stocky 4-foot capyfolk do indeed
 strongly resemble their Earth rodent counterpart.
 They are naturally quick on their feet, excellent swimmers, and Llorrai
 hunters are masters of stealth and wilderness survival.
 Unlike their Earth counterpart, the Llorrai have adapted to an omnivorous
 diet and a knack for scavenging more similar to that of rats, allowing
 them to survive easily off whatever the wilderness might offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their language, Llorran, is chirpy and flowing, rich on vowels and trilled

 and affricates (such as

 Llorran can thus be a bit tricky for some new human speakers (the trilled

Llorrai finding themselves in the service of a Guild crew will most likely
 be veterans of Paradise's jungles, with high DEX scores due to their gift
 for stealth, and will usually possess a high CON as well, owing to their
 natural constitution for wild places.
 In peacetime the Llorrai are a highly social people as well, and often
 have notable CHA scores to reflect their gift of gab.

 Many Llorrai who are not themselves from hunter-gatherer tribes are only
 a few generations removed from that life, and they are natural experts
 at foraging and hunting for food, able to survive in the wilds more or
 less indefinitely.
 Much of this talent relates to their nose, which is a superb natural detector
 of toxins.
 On a successful WIS check a Llorra can instantly detect whether a potential

 Originally this skill was of course most useful for hunting wild animals
 and even dealing with dangerous predators (it is said that those who truly
 mastered the 
\emph on
tsiella 
\emph default
would even use themselves as bait for the trap), but during the war their
 cleverness at quick trap-making proved just as useful against enemy personnel.
 Soldiers in the jungles of Paradise used to say that the worst sound you
 could hear was the simple snap of a twig, because you never knew if it
 was a simple fallen branch, or the harbinger of an ironwood spike through
 a major artery.
 Llorrai jungle fighters were known to take down entire platoons without
 ever being seen, and as modern technology was introduced, they adjusted
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experienced Llorrai are thus able to quickly assemble improvised traps from
 available materials in the wild, or even in civilized environs, provided
 they have enough time.
 Given ten minutes time, the Llorra can assemble and place a trap sufficient
 to immobilize a target who triggers it for 1d6 rounds unless they make
 a DEX save.
 In twenty minutes time, and with no distractions, the Llorra can construct
 a trap capable of causing lethal injury or poison to the victim.
 Damaging traps deal 1d6 damage, plus an additional 1d6 at levels 3 and
 6.
 A DEX save avoids the trap.
 Poisonous traps act as a disease that targets the stat of the Llorra's
 choice, is delivered by blood on contact with the trap, and has a virulence
 equal to the Llorra's level minus 1.
 The usual CON save against the poison applies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given half an hour, and access to chemicals, a Llorra can construct an improvise
d explosive device.
 This deals the same damage as the previous damaging trap, but deals it
 to all targets within 30 feet of the trigger.
 Bystanders can make a DEX save for half damage, but the creature or person
 triggering the trap takes full damage with no save.
 Alternately, the charge can be shapped to damage vehicles, dealing double
 the usual damage to a single target vehicle, but the weight required for
 the trigger means it will not activate against personnel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the type of trap involved, Llorrai traps are especially tricky
 to spot.
 There is a -1 penalty to WIS checks to spot the trap, and a further -1
 to DEX saves against the trap.

The fifth and outermost planet orbiting the star known to human cartographers

\emph on

\emph default
 in the native tongue), Kree is the capital world of an interplanetary hegemony
 that quickly became a diplomatic chessboard for the Alliance and Saurian
 powers during the War.
 The Krii themselves are a spacefaring pre-FTL arthropoid species believed
 to be descended from a lobster-like ancestor in relatively recent geological
 history, as the planet's surface is abundant with relatively primitive
 plant life similar to early Earth's, suggesting a delayed transition to
 life-bearing state.
 Their appearance sometimes leads to the application of the erroneous epithet
 'lobstermen,' but Krii are true crustacean descendants rather than simply
 a common form of plague mutation, and they are considerably more formidable
 combatants than their afflicted false cousins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Krii stands approximately 6-8 feet in height, and their bodies are
 of a roughly centaur-like arrangement.
 Their 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

heads
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 are a squat mound atop a stout thorax which are composed of a single section
 of chitinous carapace, to which is joined a segmented tail section.
 The thorax bears two forelimbs for arms, four at its base in a quadropedal
 arrangement for mobility, and two more vestigial 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

banner limbs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the back.
 The head mound contains two independent eyestalks, antennae that perform
 a range of sensory functions including audio, the mouth, and an additional
 pair of mandibles of considerable flexibility.
 The forelimbs are similar to crustacean claws, but the inside grip of the
 claw has developed more complex manipulator structures that allow it considerab
ly more dexterity than a simple pincer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The back limbs are no longer articulated, and instead stand sharply up at
 the shoulders with a slight curve, and display a prominent patterned membrane
 rather like a banner.
 The pattern on this banner is partly genetic, passed down matrilineally,
 and partly affected by the conditions of its birthing pool.
 A Krii's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The Krii language (

 though the hovering squid can do a reasonable imitation without resorting

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite their origins, adult Krii are no longer aquatic and have fully adapted
 to life on the surface, but spawn must first hatch within a body of water
 to survive until they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile form.
 This difficult reality, combined with the familial identifier in the banner
 limbs, has much to do with the nature of Krii society.
 Much of the current feudal structure has its origins in birthing rights
 and access to safe spawning grounds for Krii young.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Krii society is essentially a feudal clan system.
 Each clan is ostensibly an extended family unit, ruled by a Clan-Lord who

 female clan members who have pledged themselves as the Clan-Mother's personal

 Even conscripts of the peasantry can earn the right to take oaths as bannermen
 or one of the Mother's Swords if they should manage to demonstrate exceptional
 loyalty, honor, or bravery in the field of battle.

\begin_layout Standard
Above the Clan-Lords sits the Judge-Emperor of Krii, the high lord of the
 Krii Hegemony, from whose imperial authority are granted the hereditary
 lands of each clan.
 The Judge-Emperor is the nominal regent of the entire Krii expanse, and
 thus has the authority to both grand land-holding rights, and revoke them
 as well.
 The importance of resolving dispute of breeding pools is said to be the
 origin of the office, as the First Judge-Emperor sought to unite the clans
 under a single law of heraldry and heredity.
 The Judge-Emperor is the highest court in Krii society, as well as it's
 primary legislator, though in the modern Krii system there are checks to
 this power.
 New imperial edicts can be challenged by majority vote of the Clan-Lords,
 and a 2/3rds majority may even depose the sitting regent in favor of the
 senior heir to the throne.
 As arbiter of feudal justice between clans, it is also the Judge-Emperor's
 duty and authority to approve warfare between clans.
 Civil conflict cannot be mounted without just cause and permission from
 the regent, and unauthorized hostility can be grounds for revocation of
 clan holdings and unilateral military intervention from the other clans.
 Court politics have thus evolved into an incredibly elaborate system of
 etiquette, as one false slight or mistep can potentially be used as grounds
 to sue for war by the injured party.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is through these court politics that the cause of Alliance and Saurian
 diplomatic relations soon became a quagmire.
 The Judge-Emperor cannot issue an edict on foreign policy without an approving
 vote from the Clan-Lords, who remained sharply divided on which force to
 side with in the war, without any clear majority opinion.
 A formal resolution of neutral party status was conferred instead, and
 passed without objection from the Clan-Lords, and both Alliance and Saurian
 powers were allowed to establish diplomatic and trade ties with the Krii
 Hegemony.
 Both sides continued to attempt to win enough favor with the individual
 clans to push for an official treaty, and on two separate occasions diplomatic
 scandals led to the Judge-Emperor ejecting foreign diplomats from the capital.

The opening of the borders however, created a new opportunity for young

 however, the tt!een-g is seen as a noble quest of passage, one that has
 in times past ultimately driven exploration and cultural relations among
 the scattered clans of Krii's early history or the moons and planets of
 Krii-Ã¶ii.
 Today, many Krii ronin instead choose to go abroad to Alliance or Saurian
 space and serve as surveyors, soldiers, and explorers, a task for which
 they have proven exceptionally well equipped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Successful Krii surveyors will generally have a high STR owing to their
 expert swordsmanship, and their excellent senses tend to result in high
 WIS scores as well.
 CHA however is often low, owing to their difficulty mastering the language
 rather than any particular lack of social prowess.

\series bold
Snapping Strike
\series default
: Like their ocean-dwelling ancestors, the Krii are capable of striking
 with their forelimbs with incredible speed and strength, and modern Krii
 have adapted that instinct to their use of the sword.
 A Krii can draw and strike with a sword in the same round of combat, and
 the first such move in a combat can even preempt an incoming attacker's
 action, dealing an extra +1d6 of damage +1 per level.
 The fast twitch muscles that allow this motion tire quickly, however, and
 the element of surprise is lost after the first blow, so the technique
 can be used only once per fight.
\end_layout

\series bold
Pincer Claws

: While the Krii's pincers have evolved to contain a considerably greater
 degree of fine dexterity, the outer shell layer is nonetheless still a

 The Krii may strike with its pincers for 1d6 damage, +1 per level, and
 this strike can be made as a snapping strike (see above).

Omnidirectional Senses

 As well, their antennae are incredibly sensitive, able to detect vibrations

 or when detecting the presence of beings concealed by stealth or even active
 camouflage.

Armor Hardpoints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hardpoints are a unique feature of powered armors, developed during the
 war to add additional firepower to exo-armor units in the field.
 Hardpoints, much like the hard-points on a ship, allow the mounting of
 weapons to the armor, as well as the mounting of a few other useful bits
 of equipment common in the field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up to four hardpoints can be installed on any exo-armor or exo-jet suit,
 at a cost of 2,000cr.
 each.
 Each hardpoint can be either a shoulder mount, or an arm mount, and only
 two of each is allowed.
 Only one item of equipment can be installed on each, and they are not field-swa
ppable, due to the adjustments and calibrations involved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ranged Weapons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any ranged weapon may be mounted onto a hardpoint, and must be purchased
 seperately.
 Heavy weapons must be installed on shoulder mounts.
 The mounting will hold up to three magazines of ammunition for the weapon,
 which will be reloaded automatically by the hardpoint system.
 The weight of the weapon is supported by the frame of the exo-armor, and
 thus does not count against the carry limit of the pilot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weapon mounted on a hardpoint can be fired in two modes: manual, and assisted.
 In manual mode, the armor pilot takes direct control of the weapon, taking
 an action to fire with their normal attack bonus.
 On assisted mode, the hardpoint system's targeting takes over and fires
 independently of direct control at a flat +1 to-hit as an additional attack.
 Only one assisted mode attack can be made in a combat round, and only shoulder
 mounted weapons can be fired in assisted mode.

\begin_layout Chapter
Robots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the war dragged on, shortages in trained manpower became an issue across
 the Alliance, leading to a sudden interest in intelligent robots.
 While simple 'dumb' robots were widely in use by most of the Alliance species,
 full artificial intelligence was another matter.
 The Treaty of Durandal IV prohibited the use of disembodied human-comparable
 artificial intelligences among all signatory species after a series of
 particularly disastrous incidents involving AI, one of which nearly started
 an interstellar war, and another of which wiped out an entire research
 colony by flooding it with hallucinogenic gas after the AI became bored.
 Apparently, giving a digital entity with more intelligence than an entire
 physics department nearly limitless computational capacity and a complete
 lack of physical interaction or limitation has an unavoidable tendency
 to result in their breaking out into megalomania and genocidal rage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
S.T.E.V.E.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately for the Canis Majoris Cybernetics Corporation, however, this
 left a loophole.
 An AI system could be developed so long as it was contained solely within
 a physical body with sufficiently limited processing capacity.
 So, following on the initial success of their previous animal-analogue
 products like M.U.L.E.
 and H.O.R.S.E., CMCC began developing the Synthetic Technoid for Engineering,
 Violence, and Exploration, or 'S.T.E.V.E.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
S.T.E.V.E.'s design is heavily informed by the limitations of the Treaty.
 In addition to possessing a simpler electronic brain that limits it to
 roughly the same range of intelligence as a human save for some computational
 tasks, S.T.E.V.E.
 was a landmark development in non-deterministic AI.
 Every S.T.E.V.E.
 is designed to develop independently and randomly from the moment of it's
 virtual birth, and as a result, none is ever quite the same as another.
 This fundamental incompatibility makes it nearly impossible for more than
 one S.T.E.V.E.
 to ever share resources or combine programming, thus preventing any further
 Durandal IV-level incidents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flipside of this of course is that the process has certain ...
 quirks.
 Perhaps owing to the narcissistic personality of the original project manager
 (the name 'S.T.E.V.E.' is actually a backronym for his name), or to flaws in
 the fractal formula that generates the AI code, S.T.E.V.E.
 displays certain trends in its behavioral development.
 While every unit is different and they are more than competent employees,
 S.T.E.V.E.s have a reputation for being particularly obstinate, sarcastic, and
 surly.
 One can always count on S.T.E.V.E.
 to do what it's told, but it is significantly more to ask to expect it
 to necessarily be happy about it, and rarely will it do so without a smart
 remark.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than being a liability, however, this 'feature' helped to humanize
 S.T.E.V.E.
 to its fellow crew members, and proved especially popular with military
 and surveyor crews.
 S.T.E.V.E.'s willfulness was occasionally frustrating, but its sense of humor
 proved popular with the fatalistic attitudes of people who regularly risk
 being devoured by giant space worms or atomized in spacial anomalies.
 While later development produced models with more agreeable personalities,
 S.T.E.V.E.
 remains popular with surveyors despite, or perhaps even because of, these
 quirks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to S.T.E.V.E.'s colorful personality, the robot's appearance could
 not be more workmanlike.
 Built on a simple humanoid frame with outer metallic shell, the S.T.E.V.E.
 unit is manufactured from recycled aerospace materials to minimize both
 cost and weight.
 The standard shell is left as unpainted rust-proof brushed metal, and to
 save further money on complicated and expensive servo motors, the head
 foregoes an articulated facial structure for a simple LED matrix display
 that animates its facial expressions.
 Other than the serial number and bar code stamped on the upper right chest
 and along the upper arms, it can be difficult to tell one S.T.E.V.E.
 from another, and this confusion is only amplified by the tendency of handlers
 to not bother changing it from its default name.
 This has been known to create routine confusion when someone makes the
 mistake of calling for 'Steve' on spaceport PA systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the economical construction, however, S.T.E.V.E.
 is a durable and versatile companion for a surveyor.
 As robotic lifeform, it functions efficiently and safely in nearly all
 environments without need for filter masks, rebreathers, or additional
 air supply.
 The armored shell is designed to withstand extremes of both heat and cold
 without significant loss in function, as well as withstand significant
 physical stress and damage without loss of function.
 The adaptive AI and built-in redundancies further help keep the robot in
 top function as much as is possible.
 Its fuel consumption needs are both minimal and flexible, requiring only
 a small daily weight of natural or synthetic hydrocarbons to provide a
 catalyst for its power cells.
 The base AI seed for each S.T.E.V.E.
 unit is preconfigured with a primer on the basics of combat, starship maintenan
ce, and space exploration, though individual aptitudes in some fields will
 vary based on how the AI develops.
 An adaptive machine interface port allows the robot to directly connect
 to and communicate with computerized machinery, and a multi-purpose plasma
 tool allows for defense, cutting, welding, and soldering.
 The result is an indespensible assistant and companion for any surveyor
 crew or military unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to their standardized manufacturing, S.T.E.V.E.s do not generate their stats
 in the same manner as normal PCs.
 Variance in capability is minimal within standard manufacturing tolerances,
 but the non-deterministic AI means there can be notable differences in
 personality (CHA).
 Rather than rolling 3d6 across the board as is customary, S.T.E.V.E.s thus generate
 their standard stats from the following standard array, rolling only for
 CHA: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
STR 14, INT 12, WIS 10, DEX 11, CON 15, CHA 3d6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
S.T.E.V.E.s still may gain new stat points as they level, however, simulating
 the AI's learning process and software or hardware upgrades added over
 time.

Special Abilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent

\series bold
Armored Shell
\series default
: The external shell of the robot is designed to recieve considerable punishment
 without resultant damage to it's internals.
 All S.T.E.V.E.s have AC5 by default and ignore the first 2 points of any damage
 taken, but cannot equip other armor.
 In addition, their shell protects them from extremes of temperature from
 -200 to +600 degrees F.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent

\series bold
Robotic Metabolism
\series default
: As a robot, S.T.E.V.E.
 has no need to breathe and thus is impervious to the effects of atmosphere,
 but it does need to 'eat', in a manner of speaking.
 S.T.E.V.E.
 units must consume at least 1 pound of organic or synthetic hydrocarbons
 per week in order to fuel their interal power systems.
 This can be oil, petroleum, alcohol, meat or vegetable matter, or even
 coal.
 Failure to fuel the robot will force it to rely on reserve power, incurring
 a -1 penalty to all stats and to-hit values for the next week.
 After two weeks without fuel, the robot will shut down until it can be
 refueled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent

\series bold
Adaptive Interface
\series default
: One of the robot's fingers contains a retractable tip that serves as a
 universal adapter for most electronic or computerized machinery and systems.
 This enables S.T.E.V.E.
 to communicate directly with a given computer or machine, giving it a +1
 to checks involving such systems, and a +1 to-hit with guided or ship-mounted
 weapon systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent

\series bold
Plasma Tool
\series default
: Concealed within the right arm of the robot is a multi-purpose plasma
 tool capable of cutting, soldering and welding.
 In welding mode, the tool grants the robot a +1 to ship repair rolls, and
 in combat can be used to repair 1d3 Hull or 1d4 Armor.
 In soldering mode, the tool grants a +1 to repairing or rewiring electronics.
 In cutting mode, the tool can be used as a melee weapon that deals 2d10H
 damage, and can cut through metal and other materials given sufficient
 time (see 
\emph on
cutting torch, 
\emph default
H&H p.32).
 The plasma tool has a limited battery separate from the main power system
 of the robot, however, which holds 8 charges.
 Each use of the tool uses 1 charge, and the battery will only recharge
 after 8 hours without use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Robot Boom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, while S.T.E.V.E.
 was one of the first and still most popular intelligent robots in service
 across the galaxy, since its release there has been an sizeable boom in
 the market.
 The success of CMCC's new android lead to a wave of other robotics and
 cybernetics manufacturers rushing their own intelligent robots to market,
 with widely varying results.
 While S.T.E.V.E.
 remains one of the most ubiquitous models in Alliance space, there is now
 a wide range of robots in all shapes, sizes, and colors in active employ
 on surveyor ships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following steps are designed to allow you to generate a unique robot
 character of your own, walking you through the process of generating the
 basic details of the robot's construction and capabilities, as well as
 its stats.
 Unlike the fairly standardized nature of making a S.T.E.V.E., this represents
 a far more random option, owing to the wild spectrum of robotic life now
 working throughout known space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like PCs, robots generate their stats by rolling 3d6 in order for each of
 the six stats.
 There is no stat requirement for robots: instead, some of the systems options
 may provide further adjustments to these values, so determining any derived
 values may be best left until after the full details of the robot have
 been generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The robot's frame is the base structure on which the rest of its systems
 are mounted, informing its body type, weight, size, and Hit Dice, and may
 provide some additional adjustments to the robot's base stats as well.
 The following categories represent the most common types of frame, and
 are generated by rolling 2d6 on

\begin_layout Description
Compact This robot has been constructed with light weight as its primary
 interest, and may actually be quite diminutive in size as well, eschewing
 a humanoid frame for smaller shapes closer in size to that of a small to
 medium sized dog.
 Most 'robot pets' are ultralight, and small utility drones in workmanlike
 shapes from cubes to discs to dustbins are also common for the class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Service Service robots are those designed primarily for background roles
 as maintenance, customer service, diplomatic, or clerical work, and are
 usually humanoid in shape and appearance.
 Their light weight however does make them tuneable for agility, and this
 also makes service frames a popular choice for adapting into inflitration
 or stealth oriented combat robots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Multi-Role Multi-role frames are the workhorses of the robot world, sturdy
 and durable enough to work in a wide range of conditions, but still light
 enough to avoid hampered mobility or practicality.
 Also usually humanoid in shape, they are generally equipped with less specializ
ed and more adaptable AI software to match, to ensure maximum utility in
 a wide range of roles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Heavy
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Utility Heavy utility robots are industrial powerhouses, the diesel truck
 of robotics.
 Generally applied to industrial or construction tasks, they are more likely
 to resemble machinery than standard humanoid frames, and HU-class combat
 robots tend to be built for armament rather than maneuverability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Dreadnought The titans of cybernetics, dreadnought 'bots are built like
 tanks, made for maximum durability and lifting power.
 In the civilian world, they are likely to be automated construction or
 industrial machinery with names like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Crushinator,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and in the world of combat drones, walking tanks and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deathbots.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 They are not to be trifled with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shell of a robot is its outer casing, the body mounted to the frame,
 providing protection to the robot's internals from damage.
 Such frames vary widely in construction, from humanoid analogue 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

skins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to exo-grade armored shells capable of resisting significant combat fire.

 These shells are designed less for protection and durability than for appearanc
e and verisimilitude.
 Skins offer little physical protection, but can be made from human or alien
 analogue materials that create for a more believable appearance for android-typ
e models.
 Skins may also be employed for the weight advantage, particularly for combat
 units specializing in stealth.
 Skinned robots may wear regular armor (all types), which offers certain
 advantages in utility and maintenance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Commercial A basic commercial-grade shell, offering basic protection against
 wear-and-tear and minor knocks and dings.
 The robot ignores the first point of any damage recieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Industrial Industrial quality alloy shells provide the kind of durability
 normally reserved for heavy equipment.
 The shell provides protection against extreme environments and temperatures
 from -200 to +600 degrees F, and ignores the first 2 points of damage taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Military This shell is rated as full combat grade, able to withstand significant
 small arms fire and keep on ticking.
 The armor is also shielded against EMP attack, and ignores the first 3
 points of damage taken from any source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Exo This shell is designed to go toe-to-toe with exo-armors, a top-grade
 hardened shell able to wade through a withering amount of weapons fire
 in combat scenarios.
 The shell is fully environment protected, can withstand temperatures from
 -200 to +600 degrees F, and ignores the first 4 points of damage taken.

\begin_layout Standard
By default, unless otherwise indicated by special features (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sub:Special-Features"

\end_inset

), all robots are assumed to possess roughly humanoid or animal-like legs
 which provide the usual movement rate.
 In addition, they are assumed to possess grasping arms of some variety
 that allow for normal dexterity.

\begin_layout Subsection
Combat Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most robots in the service of a surveyor crew will be equipped with at least
 some basic combat subroutines and protocols, in order to defend both themselves
 and their crew in case of hostile action.
 Melee and ranged combat capability will each be rated separately, from
 Basic to Expert, indicating their base to-hit as shown on 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Robot-To-Hit-Ratings"

\end_inset

.
 The robot's combat software will also inform what weapons they are proficient
 with.
 Roll 2d6 on 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

All robots have a +1 CON saving throw, owing to their unique durability
 as mechanical lifeforms.
 In addition, as they possess electronic rather than biological brains,
 they are immune to attacks or effects that call for a WIS save.

Animal
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Handler The robot is programmed with special training for the handling of
 animals, giving it a +1 to INT checks to identify animal behavior, and
 a further +1 to CHA checks when interacting with animal intelligences.
 The robot may even attempt to tame Docile creatures, by making two consecutive
 CHA checks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Anti-Grav
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Lifts Rather than ordinary physical limbs to provide motility, the robot
 has a set of anti-gravity hover lifts which bear it aloft.
 Under normal operation the robot hovers approximantly 1.5 to 2 feet above
 the ground, but may elevate in short bursts to essentially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jump
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 up to 10 feet vertically.
 It may easily hover across water or other non-solid surfaces, and it is
 not slowed by difficult terrain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Bend-Arms The robot forgoes normal jointed limbs for flexible, telescopic
 appendages.
 Each arm can extend up to 10 feet independently, and owing to their inherent
 flexibility and dexterity, the robot has a +1 to DEX and a +1 to melee
 to-hit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Bio-Brain An incredibly controversial and in some jurisdictions illegal

feature,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 this robot's brain is partially or fully biomechanical, essentially becoming
 more of a vat-grown cyborg than a purely electronic lifeform.
 This allows the robot to employ limited psychic abilities (use the Bearman
 power progression, 
\emph on
H&H 
\emph default
p.20), but also makes the robot fully susceptible to psychic and mental attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Bloodhound An advanced chemical sniffer installed in the robot's sensory
 apparatus allows it to instantly detect the atmospheric composition of
 a room, detect toxic substances, and even identify trace chemical trails
 left by living organisms.
 They have a +1 to WIS checks involving smell, and on a successful WIS check,
 the robot can track such trails to their source provided they are no more
 than a week old.

Robots and Healing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As non-biological lifeforms constructed from various synthetic polymers
 and aerospace allows, a robot cannot heal itself naturally, nor can it
 be healed with standard medicinal substances and procedures.
 Instead, the robot must be repaired in order to remove damage.
 Field repair requires access to scrap parts and tools, and the robot cannot
 operate on itself.
 On a successful INT check, 1d6 damage can be repaired to the robot given
 access to sufficient scrap.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More thorough repairs can be had with access to replacement parts.
 At a cost of 20cr.
 per point of damage, the robot can be fully repaired to its maximum HP,
 though if the damage is more than 50% of it's total hit points, the service
 process will take at least 24 hours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientists and other users of Science programs can repair robots with their
 multi-tool by learning one of the nano-repair programs indicated in

\begin_layout Standard
If a robot is reduced to 0 HP or below, it is immediately disabled and will
 shut down.
 It's programming will remain intact however, and the robot itself can be
 repaired, so long as it is not reduced to fewer than -10 HP.

Equipping the Robot
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Robots are assumed to be equipped as normal by their crew with the usual
 value in credits (3d6x100), and may conveniently store up to 1/4 of their
 normal carrying weight within compartments built into their chassis.
 Robots can also be equipped with additional upgrades provided they have
 adequate credits.
